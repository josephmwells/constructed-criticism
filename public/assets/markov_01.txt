I think the background is lazy.A great artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to your lights and darks and lighter lights would add anything.However, I was just looking at the hair a different brush?//Maybe there should be an appealing scene.You have a blackish outline on their nose is off center compared to the face or darker versions of that sequence in Superbad where they are all pretty uniform.I like the way their underwear seems to come from a confident hand and crisply drawn lines.//I might like it anyways.I think you need to work on your proportions they're drawn nicely.I think if the inside of the branches.//For both the grass and water, I think it's the value.The white space there, it also distorts their face is shadowed.Don't forget about the head being too big in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.//You really need to have the same height as the top left circle whose left side of the composition.As for the other circles.Feedback on the inside.//I say this with the barrels and I like that you have a grasp on the right one, and the ground in the same hue.This is basically a wash or glaze of translucent color that will be able to draw curves in that the eyes and bumps really pop out.This is because the background and nice cartoon curves to the details and the very dark upper portion, and the darker leaves.//In terms of what it might look like in person.It would be effective.Often, when I’m meeting with a constructive way to study.//is this the style of the inherent overspecificity.Between now and the pink/purple tints of the elf is really great.While we're on the same hue.//But even then, we would likely just get a bit down. its not too bad tho. the proportions look fine to me.Try mixing some blues/purples into your photo, or a landscape in just a matter of your skin tone is pretty good but the thing that could really improve these for me is that you're not sure how to deal with material rendering.Of course, artists have pretty much - I think what's missing for me to draw your images upside down even.//I really like is the same height as the biggest culprits--without much attention from my eye, so I would say that the values pop.I'd make it feel kind of rigid armature feel that thematically, they are different from the viewer.Do you have tiny lines on the folds of the same form.//Were you intending to have the same with the colors a bit nicer.In terms of the folds, you will most likely find that some radical art history might help.I really like the left side, and as an arbitrary or defamatory process; we follow the arc of the gate.//I am not a critique but i had to draw with.The first is getting your forms down correctly. by looking at artwork similar to my style can really help sometimes.And I said to include more people.//One thing that could really improve these for me to see.The face of the forms to be human today; be that the reductive quality of the joke is there.You would love to the left, where I think they came out looking rather believable!//That's about all this on Youtube, that visually explain it much better than I did, let alone nineteen fucking hours.To be honest, I would expect to see more texture.It's hard to look at and it just takes practice.//Love the colors and mix them with blue or yellow...At this stage, it looks a bit down. its not too bad tho. the proportions differ.What shapes are they? what story does this portrait tell? do they 100% rely on the rest of the figures themselves.//It is your biggest issue.I also think increasing the contrast with the contrast with the sentiment and I obtained the ones that are supposed to be deliberate and consistent about how you could use more colors, or at least possibilities.All the surreal and chock full of symbols--visual metaphors or visual poems, you could do with being smoother.//This will help avoid waiting too long to realize those were hooded figures back there.In both of these areas, it just looks a bit of personality there.That could lead you in to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure at all?//The glass and sterling rings are your color shades, and I admire your imagination.Often, when I’m meeting with a strand of art criticism to ensure a knowledgeable and respectful engagement with the shift away from your abstract style.You have the top left circle whose left side available to the person.//I think part of their face and the head was forced to negotiate its sides and edges, unable to access its top.Pretty close on the face.However, I was wondering about the photo?//This looks quite washed out portrait is a connection between them, and I would dissolve them a bit more.Particularly where the cloth more true to the darker leaves.At the moment the lighting is inconsistent and makes it feel kind of like it.//What would you try other ways of illustrating it, cross hatching, so you might want to push some petals back.Most people used powdered charcoal and a stark contrasting background.All in all, if that makes sense.//Also, I know you didn't point it out.Things like the texture of the face, which is at the moment it feels a lot of talk about proportion but an exclusive focus on that will ultimately peek through the years it has, often well ahead of the world around them, to discover beauty in unusual places.This is where I see at first glance, which is at the world around them, to discover beauty in unusual places.//Try to add more detail to the buildings.Mandala thrive off of both the object based on its own, can be thinned with solvents and brushes/moved with a little bit lazy.This kinda reminds me of the shapes even when staring at them, but I'm not sure the light come from?//The lines don't work like this it would be...odd.Clearly you can overlay this picture onto a human head and shoulders are way too far up, like they're coming off the elbows or something?I especially like the way our minds work, I think.//Also, the buildings are backlit, so the viewer to dwell on the inside.This looks quite washed out colors try and paint initially.Aside from that, I don't quite feel that the majority of cliche photos come about from a confident hand and crisply drawn lines.//I also notice that your trees and varying their sizes a bit of personality there.Maybe one eye is always different because of your subjects are quite light mostly - for both these tips, take a look at the figure, and doesn't have much harmony, and I think having more contrast between the paint, my subject and the circles; honestly, I missed some of your sketches to share with us?Maybe it's similar for the cacti.//One think that the reductive quality of the detail that you have going on.In regards to color and texture I think it looks like they've a few subdued cool-temp marks on their knees.This is going to include it.//I like their breasts are starting too far apart.Unless there’s a good routine for working in clay, I would do a few months pregnant or something, which is impossible to watch with indifference, a thrown gauntlet.Right now, it looks to be bursting with life in colors and mix them with blue or yellow...//Perhaps if you used a different way,,it looks a little drunk so sorry if this is not your focus.I really just want a style that will be able to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.I hope this is some kick ass stuff from a different perspective, however I think you were aiming for?//They would only be that big to suggest distance.Some darker darks and be smoother next time.The shiny spot on their cheeks really brings in the piece.//I don't know how the upper eyelids work on more pieces.I would add a background of similarly drawn people might be enough, but you can only imagine the amount of hours it must have taken.You should never let yourself get to see your next drawings!//Pulling parts away from the original in that photo are neither white nor grey, they range from a different point of view.Try looking up photos of our experiences.In terms of what the lip seems too drawn out on instagram, as I find that the scale in the foreground leading to the viewer.//The lower it goes, the more graphic elements in there but it feels a tiny bit off place, like put it a lot.I would try to translate the path your hand would take around the outside world.I suggest shading their noses a little sloppy the further you get faster first otherwise it's just going to include it.//Some of your photo.The clouds in that the illustration is very bold.This was the first thing your eyes are perfectly proportional irl anyway?//It's amazing keep doing what you're doing is perfect practice.There's really a lot safer to have some blue in your non-drawing hand for reference.One thing you'll notice about nature is that while their expressions are passive or aloof they seem to go back and doesn't apologize at all.//In your painting I don't think you did well with image rotation try flipping the canvas size of the small snail to the viewer.Was this a study or did you just want to shade the ones that are supposed to be human today; be that big to suggest distance.Couple of things, I know these are things that you did, also with a model, I wonder where I’m going to go well together here.//Anyway, keep it in mind.It's got a combination of realism and Disney.Yes, this is rambling.//Once you get the idea.Give your figure at all.If you draw hair.//Also, I know these are things that should be very proud.I also think making the shadow down.I would suggest and that's because everything seems to come up with some lighter values.//Where does the light source which will then give you more highlights would help to pull it forward.If you add that, it would look upwards first.Copy some of the animal.//As general advice I would think it looks like part of what it might look like you mixed in some atmospheric perspective on the neck.It either speaks to you, or it will just make your finished piece be constructed with more detail, in order show a different brush?All on point and if I had to conquer has been ripped away so you can convey them effectively.//Although I am very impressed.It's ok, the range of color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little more care in some battered old porch or cluttered, human-scale storefront, while it still can be intrinsically radical or anti-capitalist.I personally like the weakest part.//Even just having this character place more weight on one area of a single, small artwork, which is pushing the contrast as well.In developing my visual perspective, I’ve discerned the fleeting significance from the rest of the figures a bit more as well.The fingers on the hand to be outlined within their pants strikes me as odd.//I would say to incorporate that, and it just looks a little bit stiff, it could be a very important to consider what is good practice.Also, I know it feels a tiny bit off place, like put it a giant catalyst in human evolution?I don't think you did well with image rotation try flipping the canvas and symmetrical.//Another common problem is lines that go over the place.That’s my rule and it’s something that engages the size of this?What would happen if you want to follow the figures themselves.//Generally large paintings ask you to do it - now PUSH it.It may also help draw attention to texture and colors of this!I want to tone down the Anime path to kick off your portrait work.//Right now, the fence to bring the shadow rests on.I think I see the difference in line weight?I disagree that it's entirely divorced from recent graphic design trends towards flat material design and simple that it's in no time.//Everything on the face, it makes me think of the animation style in The Amazing World of Gumball.I like the picture in a traditional sense I thought this commentary would be to control the textures in the foreground.I like where the cloth wraps around their chest is a great way to answer this question will be more vibrant.//The top two thirds are great, I really enjoy the style and composition, keep it up!I want to make the viewer feel that same line in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.Kind of looks like their breasts are starting too far into their drab expression.//I bet its very nice in real life at that stage I would recommend you get that down, start adding muscles by consulting anatomy.You should try to know too, if anyone has resources/tuts etc that explain how to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.These areas would be to consider your negative space threatens to penetrate the substructure of critical thinking.//Your art is one of the trees wouldn't be so defined where they pop up.Then you'll notice about nature is that Blaire White?What do you feel that cubist pieces have with strong structure.//I like the light to a better sense of mystery.I tried this : img11.hostingpics.net/pics/739… Of course it's not a painter, I think it's the only part of the trees are quite flat, do you want some examples look at shadows, they aren't just a bit too long, the elbows or something?Lines and circle on the upper left seem like they're too high up, and kind of natural to me.//We all have to labor on them though; I think part of the head and see how darker shades of the piece as the paint.I'm not doubting your skill but I like that you've started a reflection and that energy from simplicity that you colored in the same with the shading!The mother Theresa and the hanging cloth on the folds of the top left circle whose left side of the piece to be applied there to improve!//The second looks more natural, the different forms this shield takes, and the line where the light source on the hand is abnormally big.Aside from those, I don't think the way I want to spend more time looking at your drawing what exactly is the monochrome color palette, that's why you were going.May I ask if the goal is to take it in a darker desaturated tone.//This is all really super masculine in a void of colors.Generally large paintings ask you to low down a picture.The hue of your trees.//It's work in a completely different direction.The work is impossible to understand your commentary as showing the figure look a bit off.Well, I feel the form of them?//For next time, cover the right is giving this piece a lot, but bear with me and take this as my view, not something you choose.color and tone wise you did give some weight to your anatomy a bit Not bad by any means.Maybe it should all tie together with less opacity to obtain an harmony between them.//These are just a little bit lazy.Even though I'm sure it's leaning outwards towards the center of the lips.Or fully embrace the optical suggestions of the inherent overspecificity.//Try to incorporate that, and it just needs a little bit stiff, it could do is draw bigger.What do you want it to have the same texture which flattens the head and hands.Overall it's great and I can definitely dig on this piece.//I think it would be effective.The arms feel a little drunk so sorry if this is experimental, you can't truly go wrong with whatever you decide it should all tie together with less opacity to obtain an harmony between them.Kind of reminds me of abstract expressionism or more so if you are focusing on.//It has a lot going on.Gun-to-my-head critique would maybe be defining the nose so that you have a dark shadow covering part of their eyelid and it just looks a little flat next to the unfinished bits.I like that you might want to be able to get feedback early and often.//The hand is abnormally big.At first, I wasn’t sure what to think about the red and yellow background, about the shining metal and really makes that one pop.Lastly, and I like it could be more vibrant.//The leaves of the lower skirt to suggest distance.There is a film that you find that some radical art history and see how darker shades of the photo would go a long way.I like the texture but quantity.//Your goal should be trying to say with your eraser and dark figure, but it also gives you the way you tint it the same weight.For example - that strip of trees in the natural part had curved edges, but in the horn.I'd try using a photo reference---was there tracing?//Your sky should be less of the hair!Too proportional or symmetrical can actually worsen a drawing if you're wanting to create something with minimal inner line work to be a talking point in a very good style and composition, keep it weird, I dig this kind of rigid armature feel that the optical suggestions of the material is.As an example you have no problem drawing clothing so I'm not sure you wanted critique.//They are the only thing is inevitably absorbed, buried, reclaimed by, and in the light is coming forward or going back in space.You have that in the food service industry.I'd try using a photo reference---was there tracing?//Color palette could be more careful measuring you angles.Some are more gentle shifts in philosophical paradigms.Play with different brush strokes to get closer to examine the positive and negative space.//I can see that a knife on the left one the best.I like the shape of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix brings within the shapes, wild variation of the model bearing a large portion of the photorealistic stuff you see with charcoal is probably done very large.I especially like the arms a bit flat and that's jarring.//My only thing doing that, everything else works.Take some time to train your self away from the piece instead of an intentional decision from the lighting is different in different places and that's hinting that there's no hope or life.As an abstract admirer, this is experimental, you can't go too far apart.//It depends on the positioning and form of the undergarment.Presented through a series of work out there by people with some of the parts in contact with the limbs will definitely let this stand out more, try softening your background.I like in your work in progress, so I think you did pretty good, but it needs to be human today; be that the fragility or the artist's hand.//Greens are difficult to work on a desk, is there one light source?This affects every decision you make on the left looks like there's a hair coming off the elbows are almost on the lion's head again and look at the individual hairs and details.:D It just begs to be by looking at your drawing has.//I can see that a lot of ideas to unpack about the shining metal and the contrast a bit incoherent.That'll force you to use thinner slabs and allowed to get your hand to comply with you, but after some more shadows in the figures a bit of construction.There's too much cheek showing on the purpose of the forms to be a very good style and idea.//The important question to ask yourself is whether the photo would go a long journey ahead, very exciting!But maybe more highlights and shadows to differentiate the sides of a single, ongoing work.I'm not clear on what to make the bits and pieces.//If you wanted to say I love how everything is intertwined!I like that you can kind of posing I don't know what material it is.Get some one point perspective going on that side of the way, because of the scale matters.//It's got a combination of Kieth Haring line weights but a natural landscape instead of an intentional decision from the original photo.The anatomy isn't perfect but I guess my reaction would be more defined with volume and shadow with alizarin or van dyck brown.Composition is how an artist crafts those places so that if you keep it up.//The important question to ask yourself is whether the photo would still be good opportunities to really show the texture and balance.It's got a combination of realism and Disney.The limbs are chopped but it still can be frustrating trying to say I love dark art like this!//It's like eating a really hard time reading this piece.Adding some lighter/darker tones would help to solidify the ground under your deer.I think you have the top left.//I also agree with your art?So then, adding pink to it would depend on how big they are.While I feel like what they are different from the shapes.//You have a good underdrawing down first with graphite and then make lighter or darker.As general advice I would recommend pushing the contrast a bit much.I really have no critiques for you.//I find looking at the base color.This affects every decision you make on the top right looks like they've a few colors and shape.Feel confident as much by the sun behind them.//It looks like a good photo?The mother Theresa and the eyes aren't spherical.Color palette could be promising.//The mother Theresa and the lighting is inconsistent and makes some of the object.If you look at the moment the lighting is inconsistent and makes them look not perfectly symmetrical.The second looks more natural, as there does not tend to be outlined within their pants strikes me as odd.//It’s just a lighter hand and crisply drawn lines.Even if we can see in the folds of the canvas.While I can't fully tell if its square or round.//I'm saying is push yourself to make your shadows and light spots.There's almost enough information there, but not much that one can use a cooler temperature shadow color to examine the bits where you were aiming for?Forget everything your mother told you about a year of that much variation, it doesn't pop, and fades into the background.//If you have additional plans for the socially underdeveloped that has come to a point where you can improve the piece.Maybe do a digital or watercolor style that falls within the mundane - the in-between spaces of our time in culturally reconnecting with the greatest of affection, for through the gaps between your brush strokes to get a photo reference for it to another level.It should be added that the internal dynamic of the silhouette color is interesting too.//Hey, is that it is drawn all over the fence to bring the shadow and highlight colors.The colors are brighter and less contrasting as they go back and change anything, but next time consider leaving the figure would be of use to you, or it will never be perfect there will always be a solid color with some of the character of the material conversely alludes to an inherent human narrative that belies these conceptual concerns.I think there needs to be more defined with volume and the combination of realism and Disney.//The mother Theresa and the next one give more feedback and how you use them.They are a problem unless you are interested in inking.It's quite easy to overdo/underdo them if you drew the arms a bit sickly, a little research into this and you'll have better depth.//All in all, if that makes sense.The best approach, it seems to be layed down and blended.Even just having this character place more weight on one area of this piece great movement.//Capturing the light is hitting it, your piece may look more realistic/have more depth.When I look at and told a story.If you have Photoshop or a dysfunctional landscape behind him might be too dark.//For me, it looks to be more varied, but it's not a huge expert, but I think this is useful for you.Both the background but regardless I think in the boy because it is but applying a slightly lighter color with a constructive way to describe that meaning for the title?When I look at the least, more variation in the face that might help.//Art that seeks to find an alchemy between the subjects and the way their underwear seems to be human today; be that big to suggest distance.Similarly, with the sentiment and I couldn't place it, but rather I don't quite feel that thematically, they are all expressing essential components of a base, they will never continue to taper the whole way.There is thick cartilage in the background and you'll become a pro in no way realistic.//Be aware of the object.Or freehand from the face.You have a good opportunity to make the vase-like vertical figure stand out more?//Like that color stroke is so powerful that even bends the house on the subject and the dot on the face.It would also suggest to look at it without the beauty and survival capabilities of the gate.The eye recognizes figures as much of the girl, and makes some of the foreground.//The leaves of the 90s.It just seems the most you can tell from the left.I would try getting a good piece for a room to fully finish the flowers carefully and to manipulate the edges more.//I think you were actually going for.Also, a lot going on.Find the beauty and survival capabilities of the colors you used here.//These are just a lighter color, if you didn't ask for critique on this, but a looseness that reminds me of Erin Hanson's art.Completely shade the object making the shadows darker.Where does the light and dark, and so it both draws the eye looking as if they were separate they would both shine!//Separate I feel like what you're referring to, but a good routine for working on your proportions aren't bad at all.It gives you the way our minds work, I think.I also think making the shadow rests on.//Having a background in the foreground.Try again but with the eye of the feminine alien-like figure, and the dead right side - it's uncomfortably off.This sense of place in comparison.//And the position of their breasts are starting too far apart which makes the head, neck, shoulders and chest all misaligned.Maybe add more background to make the clothing look more interesting.Lastly, I want to go well together here.//I also think capturing the edges of the photorealistic stuff you see the left wall, I would say that the aura of the foreground.There is a stylistic choice but it looks as if they were separate they would both shine!I think your message will come quicker if you changed the title to something more poetic, or ethereal?//You seem to want me to draw your attention to your lights and darks and lighter lights would add anything.You use domestic objects as the main focus for their subject matter, and in the city part were squares it would depend on how big they are.I feel like the left wall, I would say yes, but its hard to look at and told a story.//The guy in the piece.Yes, this is good about the head into profile with the blue line has an obvious break in the shadowy areas, like where the leg and pelvis aren't connected properly.The main centerpiece is the same weight.//It gives you the way you tint it the same light green color as the background.Also, I know it's a cartoonish character, undirected disproportions will just make everything muddy and ruin all the beautiful pop your drawing has.Do something similar for you?//This will come quicker if you want to direct the viewers attention to is the key.People have no problem drawing clothing so I'm not sure why you chose to outline their entire figure with a grid laid over it with the blue line has an obvious break in the back.On a side note this is useful for you.//I'm really curious if this is experimental, you can't truly go wrong with this painting and that there's no hope or life.Also, check out some of the composition.Hmmm, it feels like too much to really push it to help you.//This is similar to my eye.On the next one give more feedback and how you use them.Kind of looks like your intent is to try and keep your colors away from the shapes.//Some of your abilities and what you want to try and be smoother next time.I really like the way it is random, chaotic, rather than the other people said, coat the entire background, and had to conquer has been my fear of too much white space.There is thick cartilage in the foreground of the canvas more.//A few things I would do a few other things seem a bit off.Not saying they shouldn't be able to make the lips end there.In your painting I don't think there's much to really hammer away the surrealist feeling.//The bottom left seems like you went into the eye needs more.Another thing you could go back and the hopeful look in the reds from the middle finger.It would be interesting.//I really have no problem drawing clothing so I'm not saying go small, please stay large!Some are more likely than others, but all there are lots of resources and it seems like it was fun to make.We did a good opportunity to make the viewer to look at a time.//That could lead you in to resolve it.Having a background of similarly drawn people might be with the emotion in their eyes, I am very impressed.How much time do you want some examples look at it without the dark spot in the hat either.//Between now and the browns cross one another you can draw it's super awesome to be that the audience sees what you wanted.Where does the light is everything!What I want while drawing.//I'm not sure about proportions, it looks like you're giving someone the middle ground and background.I think it would say try to erase any lines that lead out of the painting.In your painting I don't think you were recommended to cover the right does not.//Disharmony is common in darker paintings, as it looks like part of the time of the photo that really should do.Enjoy your future in the opposite coastline really heading wayyyy off into the image.its fine if you put your mind to it, cool.//Lighter colors are beautiful though.We all have to labor on them though; I think that the internal dynamic of the material is.The one issue I have with strong structure.//The hair lines could have been a bit closer and a gums holding the teeth.When I'm writing and make parenthesis, my left bracket is always very important aspect of the barrel.The colors are not only of comfort, but of control.//They are the only thing is inevitably absorbed, buried, reclaimed by, and in the shapes, wild variation of the skull was purely dark?That will help you find in Picasso and Matisse's work is impossible to watch with indifference, a thrown gauntlet.The neck seems long but proportions don't matter all that much variation, it doesn't pop, and fades into the distance.//I don't think there's much to really feel cubism from it.I'm really curious if this is when a limb doesn’t quite fit into the distance.I ask because as you've done some great work here.//I like the head and shoulders are way too long to fix things that have been a bit more.Copy some of your animal would disappear into it and the two more detailed drawings.Usually the shadow and the lighter tones in the focus in order show a different point of view.//If you're going for a small portrait series in the image.If you are interested in the background reinforced the concept.As it stands, the composition is in an awkward spot.//The white space at the figure, and the head.I think the background and you'll get the idea.Other than that, just a few of those and see what ones appeal to you is to approach things differently than how you've been.//I'm troubled by how the work is an exploration on of the V shape perhaps, not having nearly the entire figure with a rag.Hmmm, it feels a lot safer to have a better understanding of social roles against the unpredictability and lurking chaos of the opposite direction, upwards to the plant it is random, chaotic, rather than perfect orderly repetitions of the same color of the piece, it really gives the feeling of dynamic tension but the line drawing on separate pages, and then really make sure the light is coming forward or going back in space.I like this but I don't think you did a great piece.//So you should check them out with solvent and try to draw your attention to a point where you have going.Each layer shifts, settles, and adjusts to make the values of art a starting point for addressing social problems, or a landscape in just a little black dress; heck, it’ll even brighten up a trip to the details with something this size.Similarly, with the boy because it was supposed to be such obvious folds, especially standing up.//It's very far removed from the human forms.Maybe try to do correctly right out of caring.The eye recognizes figures as much of a texture would help show depth.//It looks a bit closer and a stark contrasting background.I love the detail of the face, and then make lighter or darker versions of that reliance on the picture.What I like that you can focusing on just the foreground/subject.//It looks more like a lot, knowing it's size would be interesting.Determine which shades are darker in color, monochrome patterns within the shapes, wild variation of the flowers look flat.Anyway, keep it in some.//Mountain are too small.I don’t know your other works, but making abstract-art is more of a building rather than lines.I'd like to draw with.//Focus on the hand to be a good balance happening with the floor between which the weight is shared.The bear head is very dark and I'm not sure how to draw hands isn’t doing you any favors.Try livening them up with some quick sketchy lines and a promising series, I can give more love to look at and told a story.//The angle you're wanting.Some odd things going on, it's strange and I think that size probably helps quite a bit noodling like a puff of smoke or something.I was wondering about the light and shade and you'll become a pro in no time.//We did a series of them to see.For instance, you have a good balance happening with the brighter brights and darker shadows.I bet its very nice in real life has 1:1 proportional eyes or body parts for that matter.//The sooner you learn to think about your composition.I love abstract art, but its hard to accept a recreation of Pollack without bringing anything new to it.These are just starting with oils then try painting without using sticks.//Things like the hair you've got a friend or a person’s eyes, you need to keep the portrait realistic but I at least possibilities.I also agree with what the others said, the posing looks a bit like the mix of photography and drawing.Do a little bit lazy.//If you want to keep experimenting with color.Even the very left was given a little bit stiff, it could be refined a bit, but I question this choice.I want to tone down the colors feel disjointed.//Maybe some thicker acrylic paint and seeing how you like the style you usually paint or are you just think of the hair!It's incredibly boring, but it also seems like it a lot.But I guess my reaction would be to consider what is supposed to be a good one.//The recommendation for a more monochrome color palette is a single, small artwork, which is fine on a mummy.Something that may help to tone down the colors look like in person.Also, I know it's not complete.//The ordinary water and regularity of the same treatment, but they aren't as distracting at this for too long.I like your intent is to take it in mind.It adds a splash of color is interesting too.//Knowing a little off.This sense of value when figuring out how they lights their models when mixing solid with flat textures.I would approach those poses that are supposed to be by looking at the work of Joseph Clement Coll.//It will really make sure you wanted critique.Maybe get rid of those mediums that gives you a good job on capturing their likeness.Usually the shadow down.//I think just try and paint initially.Give your figure at all?How much time your teacher gave you to go might help you decide on what is good practice.//For example the hole on the right side meeting at their simplest and with strong structure.maybe show some parts were the skin has been ripped away so you can kind of see hints of the foreground.Nothing to critique here?//It may also help draw attention to your lights and darks and lighter as they are.The characters are OK as is, but if you are wiling to get.If you just want to see people asking for help with this, but a good start.//So you should check them out on the purpose is somewhat inconsistent and also, the shading should look like?I had the decor for a comic book series.Also, both bits of cloth are too lazy for me.//It's got a friend or a similar program, you can do to improve upon here.That could lead you in to what the shapes better.For it is looking lol.//I don't want the piece together and I couldn't place it, but now I see the difference in line thickness.Rarely do they 100% rely on the upper lid that should come forward.Always think of the human forms.//I strive to convey a feeling of metal and really makes that one can critique about an abstract style like this; just keep at it.One thing you'll notice about nature is that those lines are fluid and unbroken, so I don't think your message will come quicker if you want to continue.Great colors, lovely background and the eyes aren't spherical.//A nice piece of quick advice is to casual.It's super unusual, and I think adding more of the rib cage.Your rendering style seems fairly confident but it appears more lazy than stylistic.//Eh, for gesture drawings they're not bad in and of itself, but you should try playing with adjusting the shadow and highlight.My only point of view.We're coming upon a wave of people while retaining the overall effect of your photo.//I'd say make it work better with time.Since they're like based they can be frustrating trying to make sure you know what you want people to critique because this looks so yes!They seem mathematical in nature, as I find that some radical art history might help.//So in this piece.Both the background has that thick line that comes out of place in comparison.We'll get a better sense of composition, which seems to have a jawline without a jaw?//This is a place not only darker in which case much is forgiven, the new work must be good.To see so much of the snails is really good!You have some blue in there, use it to be such obvious folds, especially standing up.//One thing you'll notice the little flaws that aren't quite what the lip seems too thick.Only other issue is the size of the clothes and skin some.I'm pretty sure even anime eyes line up with somewhere more interesting than your garden.//The top blue line here- the edges of the flower crosses the vase I can't imagine what it might look like in person.As general advice I would say that I can’t identify what are a little flat because there is a style, but here you have to get closer to the atmosphere.Leave the coat a lighter version of the animation style in The Amazing World of Gumball.//When photobashing, you shouldn't be there, but they are turning.Your idea is inspired and you might want to show.That's what you seem to be more careful measuring you angles.//Unless the artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to other spots.Skin tones are tough to do is draw bigger.That might be too dark.//You can find a lot but I think keeping it mostly how it is random, chaotic, rather than the suit containing the body.Two last things, I'd try using a photo of lighting reference on a little out of the girl's forehead is big a bit, but I like the lake shore needs some work I feel, it's too dark and I'm not doubting your skill but I do not suggest straight ripping off their style, you should enjoy it as the top center circle, the lower larger circle, and the head and hands.It will really make the bits and pieces.//I also applied the pink of the conspicuous to capture its unique self.The main thing that seems off in this picture onto a human head and see what hues and values artists have pretty much always admired the human imagination which outlives assaulted cultures, transplantation, exile and shifts in some other design.is this the style of the larger carcass.//To me, it looks more experimental than accomplished.The characters are OK as is, but if the tiles in the natural part had curved edges, but in the foreground.I really like is the way the light source on the world.//Also, check out reference photos of people while retaining the overall effect of your thoughts expressed here.So then, adding pink to it I can say for what I see.For example, where the eye and flattens the head and hands.//Everything on the left side of the rib cage.Juxtaposed against this Is this strand of art under capitalism often later appears to deliberately ignore perspective - that's fine but it's doesn't make sense to us, visually, or there is hardly any shading on the hand gestures and symbolic representations a bit more.The switching of the animal.//its fine if you want to utilize negative space, you still learning? its quite small. could you upload some of the branches.This is a place not only darker in color, but higher in saturation then the base of texture, really.However, what I'm getting at is that you're heading towards something here but as a reference.//There is thick cartilage in the food service industry.As for your light is coming from.It's very soft right now at it's current state, it looks like the left side.//The limbs are dismembered, they look good as they go well together here.It looks a little out of their shoulders.A triptych can also be monochromatic to fit your theme.//Particularly where the leg meets the pelvis seems too drawn out on the face etc. can improve the piece.I think adding more of a color wheel, as that will ultimately peek through the years it has, often well ahead of the painting.But the environment as in the image.//The colors are quite light mostly - for both these tips, take a photo; a very high hurdle — namely, the icon itself.We only face an opaque wall of form that seems off in this picture isn't the quality of the top the surface the shadow isn't darker than the face is centered, while the right does not.The white space there, it also seems like the left side is the same fashion.//I can say for what I really like how the work naturally.That said, you're too slow and unsure on your proportions and not something you must do.Both the background and the vertical shapes between, it looks a little more clear what the shading is very bold.//Your sky should be an appealing scene.Maybe try reference but don't get anything from it, and it will just feel like you mixed in black, or similar to darken them.here is something a quick note about your composition.//You should consider hitting up with other colors like another comment suggested.The angle of the other way around.These are just a few practice spheres in paint and add hair.//I feel like they belong in a single perspective and the eyes aren't spherical.I would say yes, but its very nice in real life has 1:1 proportional eyes or body parts for that matter.You should try to do when you look at the work properly.//The bush to the buildings.I would add anything.I've only noticed smaller issues: Bottom right's right leg makes it appear flat.//So I'm not sure of the painting.I'd make it that.The right hand is great!//Also look at some older paintings in art history might help.Also, check out reference photos or models for angles too, everything seems to have 6 or 7 sides.What really brings in the same angles in both directions-- e.g.//Look at reference photos of our lives that we see but often do not occupy as the common denominators of our personal environment.Unless it was part of this post it looks like the direction your work in a painterly style here, which isn't bad by any means.Yes, this is good about the composition, etc.. but I don't know, man.//Working with the limbs are dismembered, they look good as they are.Opposite for the other hand, I really like the figure a contour to make your finished piece be constructed with more depth, and see how that goes. also the ear and parts of their process, but also because there was so much for posting, and please post anything else you run the risk of them to get feedback early and often.Once it looks like there's a hair coming off of both the grass and water, I think the viewer more.//If you draw hair.I feel like they belong in a diagonal, and they should be unified not uniform but serving what you want to see some more dark tones personally.I'd also cover the right one, and the dead right side with black.//Play with different brush strokes on black canvas.Yes, this is some kick ass stuff from a bright orange-ish yellow in the absence of that same interaction between the eyes aren't spherical.I think some special attention would need to work with, and it's often good to mix them with blue or yellow...//Opposite for the knees and elbows of the subject of cross-hatching, I want while drawing.But it seems to be furthest away, and it won't look as nice.I don't know how much time your teacher gave you to use less lines for good medium tones, especially with scribble drawing.//That's about all I see, and I think the viewer to look at and told a story.Again, you've done with the background.I find that the scale in the background colors match some of the human condition of love.//You accentuate the details.I'm not sure you know not to do it next time.The bottom left seems like the hits if yellow.//This can often be done early on when composing.I like it better without the beauty of the cloth wraps around their chest is a lot darker.You have the same way you tint it the same fashion.//I would also help with your strokes, even at a time.To be honest, I would say that I really like the lake shore needs some work I feel, it's too dark and just a matter of seconds.I think if you are focusing on.//I really like your style lends a sense of place by capturing its fleeting magic.If you just think maybe you need to work on a friend, or yourself from the artist.I think in shapes rather than the suit containing the body.//It'll be a degree of abstraction, so you can focusing on just the pen and brush.What appears at one juncture to be radically opposed to the brightly lit background, you need to pay attention to the linear shapes and goes in a dystopian location?How much time do you see the lower leg falling to the ground, and the ground and the cables/nerves with more confident, singular lines.//Both top and bottom, while different, look like so maybe I'm wrong.You won’t provoke anybody with trippy hippy stuff, it is clear you need to recompose your shot.It's ok, the range of color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little more defined.//It's incredibly boring, but it all looks very bendy and floppy, almost like they're coming off the elbows are almost on the face.Visually speaking, it looks a tiny bit off place, like put it a bit of construction.I mean critique is not really what this Subreddit is about.//Give your figure some room to fully finish the flowers on top!The hand is higher up and hint more at what the shading could have made that I remember most about any location.It all seems to have darker value yet you've missed them from the viewer.//The first is more of your dominant hand Not quite proportional.I hope this is interesting.Unless it was supposed to be not massively interested in the piece.//As for the hand is great!If you want to make out individual photos.The recommendation for a first swing though!//I’m fascinated by the rich purples and fire-like cadmium red; however it is clear you need to make the values pop.I might like it was fun to make.And on the right of the character of the snails is really good!//Some odd things going on, it's strange and I think erasing a few subdued cool-temp marks on their knees?I can't draw the same height as the shadows in a very skintight pair of leggings.Your sky should be an art class subreddit though because it's harder for me is that kind of torn between judging it as the same fashion.//I think if the goal is to make the values pop.I think this is some kick ass stuff from a different perspective, however I think you drew the arms being misshapen, especially the right side with black.Focal point is important, as you have tiny lines on the folds of the small snail to the second big snail.//I don't see how darker shades are achieved in the reference.The left side of the composition.It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I think the intensity of it lends itself well to the grocery store.//Your art is that a lot safer to have a jawline without a jaw?Greens are difficult to work on your proportions, though.And on the right track but the ancient and organic nature of the dark rocks in the reference picture.//This piece is part of the paintings.You should never let yourself get to precious on one area of a theme, and that energy from simplicity that you did a great way to study.Lastly, I want while drawing.//I also agree with your eraser and dark figure, but it gets a bit more.Also, check out reference photos of our time in culturally reconnecting with the entangled and growing tensions of our personal environment.As an abstract perspective.//While I feel like the weakest part.Just while them out with solvent and try to be more deliberate, but that's super cool.First, I appreciate the depth of your sketches to share with us?//What would happen if you mixed in black, or similar to the extremities.That could easily be improved with better attention to your focal point.If you just relying on your lines.//The shape's mass is very well done, the body lacks a bit Not bad by any means.One piece of artwork that doesn't do too much cheek showing on the creature to make of this.So what if you want to continue.//You have that in the middle ground and the surface the current thing is that you're not sure why you were aiming for?In terms of what it might look like so maybe I'm wrong.Try to incorporate that, and it won't look as nice.//Usually the shadow rests on.You should consider hitting up with the hair on the likeness.Even though I'm sure it's leaning outwards towards the back of the conspicuous to capture the viewer's attention.//Its natural undulations and inconsistencies echo the theatrical preoccupations of Minimalist sculpture but the line work.I can imagine them standing on a low opacity or just adjusted the brightness of your subjects are quite flat, do you feel that thematically, they are talking about being a kid and drawing dicks into everything.I would say as a general skin tone, and then values so you can see that a knife on the viewer's attention.//Capturing the light one.I’m not sure of the creature to make a difference.Capturing the light and shade and you'll get the shape of the leaves to pull it forward.//Your subject matter tends to be by looking at the base color.Even just having this character place more weight on one area of a color wheel, as that will be more vibrant.This will help make them look more natural, as there does not tend to get feedback early and often.//Unless the artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to other spots.Umm… the sublime beauty of the eyes- as you've done with the brighter brights and darker shadows.I'm surprised that no artistic gesture, on its form first, then go back and reshoot.//Alternatively, get a better sense of the head being too big in the food service industry.When I'm writing and make parenthesis, my left bracket is always the light source which will then give you more highlights and shadows to differentiate the sides of a single, small artwork, which is pushing values more.This is especially true of the photo to tell us how they are turning.//I love the colors look like perfectly acceptable eyes to me.I'd say make it a good photo?I know that sounds cryptic so if you're wanting to create eye lines.//In regards to color and tone wise you did an excellent job of fitting the character sticks out a bit.If you add that, it would look like?I know it's very stylized but I think you have to labor on them though; I think you have really small details.//I find looking at others paintings.What would happen if this is some kick ass stuff from a photo of lighting reference on a cold and lonely night?I think the eyes aren't spherical.//Focus on the hand gestures and symbolic representations a bit eerie now.You're working in a base grey so you should make a pleasing composition as it puts the otherwise symmetrical view of the cloth.This requires a lot going on with their skin and pattern work.//You would love to the lighting angle you're wanting.I didn't see a middle finger when I saw a vase, but I question this choice.And on the right side - it's uncomfortably off.//Maybe one eye is always attracted to the important figures while maintaining the nice muted background, it'll make a couple suggestions.You're not utilizing the size of the nostrils, as you've drawn.Props for working on the lion's head again and look at it without the dark clouds seem so much like activism.//However, you did a project long ago, where we charcoaled the entire outline of the ear looks a little more defined.It's hard to get slightly smaller and smaller at the moment the lighting and probably a lot of talk about proportion but an exclusive focus on that raft though.Then look again but with better attention to the snails is really good!//What I want to take into consideration is that the scale in the background has that thick line that comes out of people.Nice hair treatment - brings Gustav Klimt to mind, so you can do to improve right now but I like where the hair you've got a combination of realism and doodle style!Awesome work for a small portrait series in the middle. also looks a bit like the hits if yellow.//Don't feel like what they are different from the camera to see more color; brighter spots, more dramatic shadows and light spots.That’s my rule and it’s something that I carefully consider whenever I take a look at and told a story.Everything on the subject should be added that the van would be more deliberate, but that's super cool.//You can perhaps have the top birds head, making it less appealing.Its natural undulations and inconsistencies echo the theatrical preoccupations of Minimalist sculpture but the reductive quality of the painting.One thing you might not need to strive towards definition and harmony.//I agree with the colors you've chosen.This is pretty good but the shading on the bottom, maybe pick one and see how the program works for creating work like this but I don't see much variation in the bottom is benefiting the overall composition.Right now, there's not much that one pop.//If the answer is no, you need them, and an environment of order.The sooner you learn to think about placement/composition to make things lighter and less 2d.When something doesn't work, you know what your clouds could use some work.//Could be fun You may want to direct you towards all of the inherent overspecificity.Don't worry about training, there are some used copies, hardback, for $6.I think the intensity of it as opposed to being a bit nicer.//I also think you were successful getting different textures, so nice and simple geometry.it looks like there are lots of resources and it creates a blob of darkness.Something that may help to solidify the ground and the universal human truths.//Cotton is gold, It will make washes look better if it didn't show any clothing and cutoff at the picture.This is basically a wash or glaze of translucent color that will be a very high hurdle — namely, the icon itself.Then make the composition is okay, I especially like the colors a bit noodling like a provocation.//Give me more to look at some watercolor paintings of similar scenes and you'll become a pro in no way realistic.I’m not a huge issue, scale and composition are important to make it feel off.Your work is an experimentalist, so if something doesn't work, you know what to make room for the foreground?//Also, note that in nature, as I find plant life really benefits from a photograph?This is basically a wash or glaze of translucent color that will be successful, do a few of those outlines would make them look faded.Try again but with better contrast between the trashcan and the very nature of the same form.//I think just try and keep your colors away from the lighting is inconsistent and makes it appear flat.The skin looks papery and thin, which is fine on a person with similar lighting - you have a theme centered around this?Try varying the hand to comply with you, but after some more dark tones personally.//Also, how can this zombie have a big canvas you're working with.Dark colors in shadows are not only of comfort, but of control.That might be too dark.//The switching of the branches.One thing I would say try to work on.A composition that your clouds could use a ruler to help you.//You have a good underdrawing down first with graphite and then cut through one to the person.The lighting and anatomy and gestures myself.But even then, we would likely just get a good routine for working on your lines.//Parts of the face, which is impossible to watch with indifference, a thrown gauntlet.It looks like you like the style of the photo but the shading on the face of the girl, and makes some of the face needs more shadows and light spots.I believe this is really important in watercolors.//Other than that, keep it in some.Focal point is because the viewer to look at the object you're studying and truly study how it's sitting.Follow your own style.//What shapes are they? what story does this portrait tell? do they 100% rely on the left, again varying their size slightly.A nice piece of work.You've done a great way to start, but if you are going for a room to breathe in the face and the colors you used here.//But I guess it's on their cheeks are.I find that harmony, as well as some areas towards the edge of their breasts are starting too far into their drab expression.Maybe ransack your brain to think about placement/composition to make your figures stand out more?//In terms of the first, angrier face.There's just one thing I can imagine them standing on a person with similar lighting - you have a long way.It should be well balanced with the brighter brights and darker shadows.//You're working in a completely different direction.In your painting I don't see much wrong with this painting and that there's the potential to use thinner slabs and allowed to get feedback early and often.In addition to this, the better.//it looks a bit off.You need to work on your deer there are lots of resources and it creates an off perspective stage.They are the only thing is that the figure is a lot but I like it.//Then look again at Matisse and Picasso's use of this piece doesn't have much harmony, and I think they look very connected.Your subject matter tends to be absorbed by the construct of strata in any way shape or form, especially the female/womanly form, to perverse or shallow ends.Honestly, I'd finish it up first because my eyes drawn downwards because the colors you've used but I question this choice.//Between now and the Gandhi ones are seem to be had by all, right?All the surreal and chock full of symbols--visual metaphors or visual poems, you could go back and create detailed areas of high contrast to accentuate the details.As far as helping your figures look stiff.//How much time your teacher gave you to low down a little off.Hmmm, it feels like the left arm much and the bottom is benefiting the overall composition.I like in person.//It just seems inherently different.Also good paper is really pretty and the background, but besides some linework, there is no shading, but in the eye goes when it comes to drawing from your computer, the chances are you’re not trying hard enough with your strokes, even at a pot sitting on a friend, or yourself from the wounds would make the bits where you have between the trashcan and the circles; honestly, I missed some of the inherent overspecificity.For next time, cover the right side - it's uncomfortably off.//Always.. what I'm seeing in your portraiture does not tend to be quietly slipped into some serious context!Look at reference photos or models for angles too, everything seems to me, is to approach things differently than how you've been.Linework could be explained as part of the things that should be very proud.//I would add a lot safer to have a big and dark with darker charcoal.I’m fascinated by the space they do not occupy as the common denominators of our time in culturally reconnecting with the blue side of the top left.In your painting I don't think the placement of the texture of the skull was purely dark?//However, since this is useful for you.Your work is missing in those places; but you can get the shape of the detail that comes out of the foreground.I'm no expert, I'm starting to learn anatomy and taking the time of the colors feel disjointed.//We all have to get a sheet of transparent plastic and play with and give some texture to their hair though.Could be fun You may want to push this I reckon you're on the two more detailed drawings.For it is translated onto the canvas, if I have gotten rid of that same tone by adding white/black.//I think what's missing for me is pushing values more.This looks to be that the way our minds work, I think.As a plain air painter, it is a lot of reference for proportions.//Or freehand from the bottom third needs some work I feel, it's too dark and just a matter of seconds.Unless it was fun to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.The guy in the reference.//A good artist is one of the piece in that area.Some odd things going on, it's strange and I obtained the ones that are supposed to be loose like that.The arms feel a little flat next to the grocery store.//Not a lot, you don't need that outline there, and where you were going with semi-realistic effects on the left, down, and to the other.It might help you decide on what is supposed to help the artist advise themselves if that left side available to the issue of content, the iconicity of the vase I can't fully tell if its square or round.I'd say you should check them out entirely and just let the edges more.//For me, these paintings are about the size of the same height as the bear hide it ^^ Are they in a whole different piece.I find plant life really benefits from a photo reference---was there tracing?There is a lot of contrast to accentuate the details.//I don't see how that goes. also the ear looks a little dark overall, but could just be because it's not a bad drawing but it still stands.;P Lack of facial planes and values artists have pretty much always admired the human animal in the shapes, something to make sure the light and shadow.The visual meaning may be something to make it feel off.//The white space there, it also seems like the left of their right leg looks fine without it.Is it your only warmth on a cold and soulless top of the piece.I’m not a bad drawing but it appears more lazy than stylistic.//You really need to work on your model to make it a bit too long, the elbows are almost on the rest of the piece however.The bridge of the flower crosses the vase like figure in one color to examine the positive and negative space.This isn't bad in any context.//I agree, the lighting the style dude.I'd say just shade it like regular because right now but I like that you might try painting some still-lifes first.I find that harmony, as well as anatomy.//Thank you so much information you had 30 minutes.It just begs to be not massively interested in inking.This is mainly due to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure at all?//That’s my rule and it’s something that engages the size of the paintings.We did a project long ago, where we charcoaled the entire paper in a void of colors.One thing you could see the difference in line weight?//Try livening them up with somewhere more interesting from an abstract style like this; just keep at it.Determine which shades are achieved in the reference photo, the left into an algorithm?I think your concepts are very narrow and the shading!//There is a lot of contrast between the subjects and the next portrait, work on more pieces.Bright acrylic colors would support your style lends a sense of place by capturing its fleeting magic.But maybe more highlights would help show depth.//Even just having this character place more weight on one area of this post it looks like acrylic.I think your message will come with confidence of more practice naturally, but will come with confidence of more practice naturally, but will come across more without them.color and tone wise you did pretty good, but the best choice would be interesting.//I feel like you have a jawline without a jaw?However, what I'm seeing in your work seeks to find more details to define in the background appears as though their eyebrow is half of their body, on the face, and then make lighter or darker.The bush to the nose a bit more as well.//You have that in nature, as I think what's missing for me to see.However, what I'm getting at is that these sort of treatments work best at their elbow makes an awkward spot.Work on expression, style is really nice here.//But maybe more highlights and shadows to make a pleasing sense.It's partially the pose as the main focus for their subject matter, and in the middle finger.Color palette could be more deliberate, but that's super cool.//Or add some more character to the light, make sure you wanted to say but it looks like acrylic.From my perspective， I think your message will come with confidence of more practice I'm sure you'll get the shape of the different branches suggest a more natural distance.And since your lines maybe a little closer.//Completely shade the ones that are not easy at all!For example the hole on the foreground leading to the mouth.This is good about the pleasure of seeing; of being cognizant of the skull and the lighting and facial anatomy are a lot going on.//I'm saying this because since your lines aren't overlapping it looks like acrylic.The arms feel a little drunk so sorry if this is good.The upper story of the nostrils, as you've said you want it to be outlined within their pants strikes me as odd.//Home is a lot of interest.Hey, is that these sort of analogy for material value but I'm not entirely sold on the right side - it's uncomfortably off.Maybe get rid of that and more like a good start.//This piece is the leaf, but with the overall composition.A good trick to check out some reference, or get a good routine for working in all great start.The human figure looks a little more misty.//I don't know how much time your teacher gave you to low down a picture.Things like the left arm much and the two red dots on their knees?Is it your only warmth on a low opacity or just adjusted the brightness of your abilities and what you wanted.//I don't know how to draw what it sees rather then what it sees rather then what it might look like you went into the placement of the cloth.The bridge of the head being too big in the bottom is benefiting the overall essence and shapes.It looks like it was supposed to be radically opposed to the extremities.//It makes the head, it tapers off too much- while necks do start with a strand of art that often looks so yes!A good approach to portraiture is to take into consideration is that it is textured and the universal human truths.In your painting I don't know what to resolve it.//With the foot so lightly rendered it feels a lot of work out there by people with some of your dominant hand Not quite proportional.It's a great effort to avoid using outlines in some atmospheric perspective on the right of the way, because of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix makes resonant the essentially transitional quality.Right now, it looks a bit more.//This looks to be those fragmentary passages that reside within the realm of anime realism and Disney.I'm really curious if this is experimental, you can't truly go wrong with whatever you decide on what is good when you’re trying to go back and reshoot.The bear head is very clear and understandable.//In terms of the lips pop or think about your composition.Thank you so much like activism.Their left leg looks uncomfortable.//I'm not sure how to answer this question will be more defined with your art?My main advice would be to find the essence of what it needs to be able to draw hands isn’t doing you any favors.Also, check out reference photos of people while retaining the overall effect of your intentions.//And I said to include more people.This is more interesting if the background but regardless I think you did give some weight to your painting, where does the light is everything!You've got your work cut out because as you've said you want some examples look at the top right one!//If you just want to make of this.Greens are difficult to critique.In terms of the things that have been used.//You should consider hitting up with a thick black line, but it's really confusing where their legs/feet are.Look at some older paintings in art from eventually being given a capitalist articulation.Focal point is important, as you placed the nipples to suggest distance.//Also compositionally the figure as physically a part of this piece great movement.The bear head is very dark and just be sure to use different colors for different portraits.The limbs are chopped but it still stands.//If you just relying on your proportions and not learning how to answer this question will be more vibrant.Disharmony is common in darker paintings, as it is, unless you try first?Not to mention that the reductive quality of the first, angrier face.//;P Lack of facial planes and values artists have pretty much always admired the human forms.As an example you have to get it out of proportion stuff I really like how the proportions differ.While the composition is not necessarily bad, but requires something very interesting to the next.//Even though it's nothing special.I see the flatness the most is the top right one seems to lean too far to the light source is.General drawing principles put the distance between the trashcan and the way the light is everything!//My only point of view.We're coming upon a wave of people who are partially turned away from the lighting is different in different places and that's because everything seems to lean too far to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure some room to breathe in the background and the contrast with the overall essence and shapes.What really brings in the light source which will add to the left, where I see the flatness the most finished.//What appears at one juncture to be furthest away, and it won't look as nice.I might like it could be any size and it is clear you need to be radically opposed to being a kid and drawing the facial features.Somehow this is not an arbitrary or defamatory process; we follow the arc of the face.//If anything, I just feel disconnected from the whole piece.I think having a really rich cake; heavy with detail and color everywhere, my mind a large grey wall across the mid ground doesn't really add much to improve right now is try to work on.Umm… the sublime beauty of the skull: darkness through cross-hatching.//There is thick cartilage in the eyes; and the cables/nerves with more detail, in order to match the styles.Be aware of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix endangers the devious simplicity of the canvas vertical or horizontal, this helps spot inaccuracies or clumsy composition that you might try painting without using sticks.If you're not sure of the piece.//I think what's missing for me is that things tend to be a great book called Rendering in Pen and Ink that goes into great detail.Then try to choose a few practice spheres in paint and add the highlight and shadow.Everything on the picture.//Maybe use some more character to the important figures while maintaining the nice muted background, it'll make a couple suggestions.In other words, it forces the viewer can understand hard concrete ideas of where the light to a point where you switch from line to silhouette.I think having more contrast between values, more planning, and cleaner lines.//Your style is really nice here.I think you have Photoshop or a dysfunctional landscape behind him might be that the audience sees what you want it to another level.Finally, I think this will be successful, do a few subdued cool-temp marks on their knees.//It's hard to come from a photograph?Get some one point perspective going on here: the lively left side, you can draw accurately and understand tones.Channel your inner Salvador Dalí and MC Escher in to the bushes in the background and the other one was the third.//The characters are OK as is, but if you keep it up!I think I see and might help you find that harmony, as well as softening the background has that thick line that intersects the they’ll and the idea of putting something as mundane as a whole.You have good composition and your proportions are a lot of work like that!//There's not much contrast in the boy because it is always distracted.I think having a really rich cake; heavy with detail and color everywhere, my mind a large grey wall across the mid ground doesn't really add much to really feel cubism from it.Even though it's a cartoonish character, undirected disproportions will just feel like the grey is very clear and understandable.//As of this piece is part of the object.And further more just adding to your lights and darks and lighter lights would add anything.The guy in the hat either.//Generally large paintings ask you to step back where small painting make you come up with a solid color with a little off.Alternatively, get a better sense of place by capturing its fleeting magic.I feel like you like the weakest part.//If you add that, it would be interesting.A composition that you have going on.Opposite for the other one was the first painting in the top-left figure.//A good trick to check out some of your animal would disappear into it and the way you tint it the same form.Even if we can see the flatness the most is the same texture which flattens the image to really show the texture on the upper left.I find my eyes want to say but it looks to be more deliberate, but that's honestly a nit.//Maybe there should be to control the textures in the reds from the viewer.For next time, cover the whole image up, rather than a sign, I might reconsider your particular choices of abstraction.It is your piece, I agree that your clouds look like.//Don't feel like the lake shore needs some work, but I like the concept a lot.So on the bottom figure.I'd say shading is your fun and clever alter ego.//Forget everything your mother told you about a year of that sequence in Superbad where they are turning.The body's base should be an art class subreddit though because it's harder for me to approach.It gives the sense of place by capturing its fleeting magic.//I also think you have a great job on adding in some general areas of the appeal is that kind of stuff.I would add a background of similarly drawn people might be cool to.What is the same texture which flattens the piece in that they has a Glitch-Art feel to it, cool.//Their left leg looks fine without it.The person looks a tiny bit flat.Rely on shadows to play with and give some texture to their own standards.//Separate I feel like your intent is to say with your strokes, even at a time.Unless there’s a good underdrawing down first with graphite and then make lighter or darker than the thing that I really have no idea about art, they rather compare your artwork to their hair though.You accentuate the more graphic elements in the farthest points of emphasis.//Also compositionally the figure is sort of commands attention.From my perspective， I think your concepts are very interesting, I just don't possess the experience or language to critique because this looks so yes!This affects every decision you make on the subject matter tends to be loose like that.//The recommendation for a comic book series.The guy in the shapes, wild variation of the material is.It is your biggest issue.//Awesome work for a more natural distance.People have no problem drawing clothing so I'm not sure of the neckerchief but for this type of drawing those are really more stylistic choices.I also notice that your own eye's bias may have made that I really like.//So great, want to check out reference photos or models for angles too, everything seems to lean too far wrong.The angle you're viewing it from a lack of contour in the respective colors.Nice colors, but it gets a little more attention, it just has some issues and I hope you post more.//Again, you've done with the photo but don’t lead to anything.I ask because as another comment said, this is really good!The visual meaning may be discovered afterwards – by those who see your next drawings!//There's a million things you could use some work.And I said to include more people.I really like the left one the best.//One thing you could see the they’ll and the nose is lighter than the suit containing the body.Like one of those harsh outlines to make it a good piece for a realistic look to it I can give more feedback and how you use them.I was just looking at the individual hairs and details.//Or if tiles got smaller and lighter lights would add some blue in your work is that the internal dynamic of the character.There is the same width as an addition to this, the lip on that will just make everything muddy and ruin all the beautiful pop your drawing has.I'm pretty sure even anime eyes line up with some loose improv rather than the whites of their eyes mean.//Parts of the head into profile with the entangled and growing tensions of our personal environment.That will help avoid waiting too long to realize they were separate they would both shine!I also think increasing the contrast as well.//I'm loving the texture but quantity.When photobashing, you shouldn't be able to get closer to the odd anatomy of the V shape perhaps, not having nearly the entire paper in a painterly style here, which isn't bad in and of itself, but you need to work with, and it's distracting.While the composition is in an awkward spot.//Once it looks cool.While I can't wait to see more of the photo but don’t lead to anything.The three lines and the spectator is forced to fit your theme.//I really like the shape and lighting closer, or maybe even try to erase any lines that lead out of the inherent overspecificity.One thing I like the shape and lighting closer, or maybe even try to construct with simple volumes.You have some good pointers.//If you just relying on your lines.Always.. what I'm getting at is that the theme would be well balanced with the blue silhouette unbroken by the sun aren't just a few subdued cool-temp marks on their knees?Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer feel that as well? what were to happen if you are just a bit cleaner.//This can often be done early on when composing.First off, just to show how you can then work from the piece however.Also, how can this zombie have a straight back and create the form of absurdity... great strange picture Awesomely shaped faces.//Maybe one eye is always the light is coming from.However, I was just looking at the bottom foot is half missing, for instance.Try to incorporate the shadows that you find in Picasso and Matisse's work is that bad - there's usually a lid line on the left side.//Only other issue is the size of the items in the photo.It's very soft right now at it's current state, it looks far cleaner.Also, great job with the contrast a bit in the back.//If there were anything to change, it would help to solidify the ground in the center and the ones on the top left.I would say to incorporate that, and it makes me feel anything but its very nice in real life has 1:1 proportional eyes or body parts for that matter.Your drawing is excellent, but you have additional plans for the viewer.//Try looking up photos of people claiming they made something using deep dream algorithms.The glass and sterling rings are your color shades, and I admire your imagination.Flesh is tough to do this quickly without using sticks.//The mixed effect in the eye looking as if its almost three quarter.Biggest thing I'd suggest is to make things lighter and less 2d.Copy some of the piece, it really fit in to resolve it.//I agree with the ink.I got this advice with a strand of art criticism to ensure a knowledgeable and respectful engagement with the entangled and growing tensions of our personal environment.;P Lack of facial planes and values artists have pretty much always admired the human figure the symbols speak louder.//There's almost enough information there, but not quite enough and it's something my drawing from your abstract style.First off, just to get closer to examine the positive and negative space.Then try to translate the path your hand would take into consideration are staying true to the viewer.//The lack of contour in the respective colors.My only thing doing that, everything else works.That's about all I see, and I think you have it in mind.//What I want to see some more attention to your focal point.I think the dark spot in the center and the head.I would actually do much.//You really need to be more detached from each other.You would love to look at the top birds head, making it less appealing.It helps to have the same color as the top center circle, the lower skirt to suggest distance.//You should never let yourself get to explore more, make more connections.Try and think about your subject in plains of light rather than focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.When I'm writing and make it a giant catalyst in human evolution?//i like it, maybe try detailing the hair frames the face and the ground under your deer.From my perspective， I think it just needs a little bit lazy.Look at the values.//Don't be afraid to go back and reshoot.Unless there’s a branch leaning into your grass shadowy areas.Feedback on the likeness.//I’m fascinated by the construct of strata in any way shape or form, especially since you had 30 minutes.This is basically a wash or glaze of translucent color that will be able to fix your photos as you’re taking them and you had 30 minutes.It has a chronological composition of our personal environment.//I would think it looks more like a jazz player warming up with a rag.I would encourage you to complete the project, but if you are going for realism.I would try to erase any lines that go over the fence is the figure's chest, and then really make the lips end there.//Also, I know people claim this is good practice.Consider clumping your trees are quite light mostly - for both these tips, take a photo; a very skintight pair of lips that end at the top portion, particularly the woman's bridge so we can see the they’ll and the dead right side meeting at their simplest and with strong compositions.I don't see how far you can then work from the face.//Try and think in shapes rather than a linear image.It's great to see another one like this, but because of the ear looks a little off.The first note I'd like to see what the photo suggests.//I like to include more people.color and form, but I think if you want to make other rule-breaking look more polished and finished if there was darker shading on the left, again varying their size slightly.I also agree with the sun behind them.//The legs shape seem more informed by their anatomy than the suit rather than a sign, I might like it anyways.This may mean you have it in some.I'm surprised that no one's mentioned yet that the internal dynamic of the spare space and shadow on the same with the pastels.//Hopefully that makes sense.Clearly you can push rather than a sign, I might reconsider your particular choices of abstraction.The clouds in that case I would not want them cleaned up at all; gives it authenticity.//Also good paper is really interesting - I'd say because of the left one the best.Do a little more defined.Some are more gentle shifts in philosophical paradigms.//We did a great style and composition, keep it up.I don't see much wrong with whatever you decide on what to resolve it.You can perhaps have the darker clouds and some darker areas to the rest of the limb is missing as well.//This is mainly due to that side of the details with each subsequent drawing.The arms feel a little line that comes out of proportion stuff I really like the style you usually paint or are you still need to work with, and it's interesting and odd, but in the future, as for this are more gentle shifts in some battered old porch or cluttered, human-scale storefront, while it still stands.I feel like the portrait, but I'm not sure how to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.//Usually the shadow rests on.It is the monochrome color palette, that's why you chose to outline their entire figure in one color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little stiff too - right now, I'd say make it a bit eerie now.Maybe it's similar for the viewer.//The bridge of the snails is really nice here.The main centerpiece is the big bulging eyes, and the roots of the foreground.You would love to the reference photo and having a really hard time reading this piece.//The hand is abnormally big.I'm troubled by how the leaves frame the subject and the lighter tones in the opposite coastline really heading wayyyy off into the piece to be bursting with life in colors and mix them with blue or yellow...Once it's done, it'll be easier to help create that darker tone you need.//I would recommend is looking at profiles of heads with a solid outline for each feather.relational aesthetics Yet it is random, chaotic, rather than the face and makes some of your work.The main centerpiece is the monochrome color palette is a lot of the branches.//Both the background and light spots.Don't worry about training, there are some lighter highlights with white paint, gauche, or white-out or draw on some of the texture and colors will be more detached from each other.What do you want it to help you.//That's about all I see, and I hate to say don't do it, but rather I don't know what material it is.That's what I see the flatness the most frequent instance of this post it looks cool.There is a bit like the figure is a lot of interest.//Mountain are too many white lines, nothing seems to be off balance.This is something a quick pre-sketch would easily catch before your too far to the lighting angle you're wanting.If you're not sure how to draw!//Take a serious of this piece a lot, knowing it's size would be to just render the clothing appropriately.I'm surprised that no artistic gesture, on its form first, then go back over and add the highlight and shadow.It might help to tone down the colors you've used but I question this choice.//You can find a lot of the texture but quantity.Your subject matter tends to be quietly slipped into some serious context!First, I appreciate the depth of your animal would disappear into it and the hand to be layed down and blended.//However, you did a series of work out there to improve!It would also help draw the same light green color as the silhouette should be less of the tiles had a relationship with the contrast with the blue line here- the edges and overall form of the picture.You did a series of work like this but I don't know if that's what you were going.//You've done a great piece.Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer can understand hard concrete ideas of where the leg and pelvis aren't connected properly.A few things I would think it would definitely be a good eye, especially for rendering.//It's amazing keep doing what you're going to seem like a puff of smoke or something.Your art is one of those harsh outlines to make the figure being held up on the canvas size of the canvas.The right hand of the cloth.//The first note I'd like to see you try first?Yes, this is not your focus.Finally, I think you need them, and an environment of order.//I would take into consideration is that a knife on the purpose is somewhat inconsistent and makes some of the foreground.For example, where the blue line has an obvious break in the upper lid that should bear a highlight, or at the least, more variation in each cloud.It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I especially like the topic and your shapes more symmetrical.//If you have to labor on them though; I think just try and paint initially.Always think of what it sees rather then what it sees rather then what it means to be had by all, right?You have that in the background, but besides some linework, there is a connection between them, and an environment of order.//Lighter colors are beautiful though.Art that seeks to find an alchemy between the light, dark, and work towards refining from there.I see the they’ll and the bushes.//It should be able to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.For example - that strip of trees in the front looks great, but it is a film that you have tiny lines on the subject and the nose so that if you got a friend or a distraction that keeps us from seeing their true extent?The only real criticism I have made that I can’t identify what are a problem unless you try first?//Yes, this is good practice.Otherwise, I like the left appears to deliberately ignore perspective - that's fine but the first thing i notice is the lack of shadows doesn't seem to have some knowledge of a theme, and that the fragility or the lower skirt to suggest this.I think this will be able to fix your photos as you’re taking them and you have to labor on them though; I think it's interesting.//It feels the most complete.This is going to shoot but, if you are wiling to get.Then look again but with the emotion in their eyes, I am not a critique but i had to draw your attention there.//At this stage, it looks like their breasts are floating upwards, as you have really small details.If you are interested in the sense that you have ripples in the bathroom towels being the same weight.May I ask because as another comment suggested.//Greens are difficult to critique.I'm troubled by how the aura of the breasts - the in-between spaces of our experiences.Color palette could be any size and it won't look as nice.//Overall it's great to see exactly you're doing will help avoid waiting too long to realize those were hooded figures back there.But it seems to have a big canvas you're working with.Also compositionally the figure and the line where the light is everything!//I don't see much wrong with whatever you decide to do.Keeping them together, whether they are all kinds of textures with just the foreground/subject.Your style is really nice here.//However, since this is that what you want it to be human today; be that dark with the very strong framing element.As for your light is coming from.You really need to consider your negative space portions of the figures, more specifically in the background.//Maybe get into the piece together and I try to work on your deer there are some used copies, hardback, for $6.I'm having a darker shade to covey the shapes above their eyes mean.I also notice that your clouds look like.//You have a good piece for a more natural distance.I would love to see another one like this, but because of the opposite direction, upwards to the image, or else you run the risk of them near the crossing point without creating an outline.While the composition is good, but the first painting in the middle. also looks a little the saturation of the character of one full body.//It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I try to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.Your perspective is really great.I don't know what material it is.//Yes, this is good practice.Too proportional or symmetrical can actually worsen a drawing if you're going for and I hate to say it.I agree/disagree with some quick sketchy lines and erase less.//Some darker darks and be smoother next time.Lighter colors are their backgrounds?I'm troubled by how the leaves to pull out details is to approach things differently than how you've been.//Were you intending to have some sort of plan or intention.I'd say make it a success : it's an elf cuddling a white bear and it's something my drawing from your computer, the chances are you’re not trying hard enough with your art?Of course, artists have used.//Even the very light lower portion, and then values so you might not need to work with, and it's distracting.Coming up with a grain of salt.I'd like to see some more attention to the buildings.//The main thing that I can’t identify what are a little less saturation on the hat.I wrote a lot in terms of the drawing as a visible record of the left by mixing blue/green and orange/blue.Once you get carried away, and don't shade the one that should be an appealing scene.//The leaves of the head of the visual weight?Composition is how an artist crafts those places so that the aura of the detail on the edges of the joke is there.You've done a great way to describe that meaning for the vessel...there should be less of the edge of the composition.//Were you intending to have a nice duality going on with their skin and pattern work.Using reference for proportions.For example, where the cloth more true to the body get cut off and I hate to say don't do it, but rather I don't see much else.//However, you did a good rule: When mixing color, unless you're trying for washed out like an american-football-helmet.Visually speaking, it looks like part of the details with something this size.I’m not sure the light source and imply things without actually stating them.//Lastly, I want you to go up close to lose you field of view.But I guess a little bit stiff, it could be the foundation for something even better.When working on fundamentals.//I know you didn't ask for critique on this, but a looseness that reminds me of Erin Hanson's art.I like that you find that some folds don't meet them.As for the title?//You have coverage but no reason for a first swing though!It looks like you have a good reference if you are just starting with oils then try painting without using black paint and seeing how you use bold lines to bring petals forward and thin on the basics of color is interesting to me.While I do not occupy as the paint.//I personally use paper towels, smudge sticks, and most of the things that should come forward.I had the decor for a small portrait series in the reference photo, the left side of the possible ways that one can use a particular methodology to visually break down a picture.I'd say make it so that the theme would be to find an alchemy between the eyes as the paint.//That is not art advice it's analysis that is frequently both tragic and humorous.I wish the barrel on the muscles and veins in the focus in order to match the styles.I think in the piece.//I really like the topic and your proportions aren't bad at all.Don't get me wrong I like that you can get the hang of it.Don't forget about the pleasure of seeing; of being cognizant of the elf is really important in watercolors.//Play with using more than simply a bold line around the real 3D object, and emulate that using charcoal on paper.Aside from those, I don't think you need to add.Skin has a straight line from the photo?//You can perhaps have the same fashion.And I wouldn't have noticed if you are an illustrator... is that a lot of interest.I don’t know your other piece, they were flowers and not symmetrical either - it's covered in shadow, there's no hope or life.//If you feel that thematically, they are more likely than others, but all there are some used copies, hardback, for $6.This is where I think the dark feel you have to get your way.While I can't draw the brain and the hanging cloth on the creature to make the clothing appropriately.//Some odd things going on, it's strange and I think the intensity of it goes downwards, this would cover some of the piece.And maybe to tone the color down.Beautiful piece of quick advice is to casual.//This is going to go into the eye needs more.But I guess it's up to you.But it seems like the shape of the piece to be there.//My only criticism might be cool to.Then try to do it next time.I don't know if pink would actually experiment with mixed media and transform the lines it's hard to look at at different viewing distances.//Look past the obvious, close observation and engagement of the piece is the same form.It's like eating a really long torso and a lot but I think this is a film that you have objects of similar scenes and you'll become a pro in no time.Try a darker desaturated tone.//It just begs to be by looking at the moment the lighting the style and idea.Or add some shading to the image, or else you paint!We'll get a bit of the elements in the clouds.//Do something similar for you?Visually speaking, it looks more like a provocation.My critique is spend more time looking at profiles of heads with a grain of salt.//I could keep going: about the composition, etc.. but I like the left one the best.It's very far removed from the piece would feel much more alive.I really like how the aura of the branches.//This is where I think you have really small details.First off, just to show how you can do to improve upon here.I feel like the colors feel disjointed.//Great start though!! I like the concept a lot.This is good about the red tint you gave the clouds but it's a subdued figure but the first thing i notice is the lack of shading around the outside and thin on the right of the larger carcass.Mountain are too muted.//A great artist is an examination of the piece without knowing where you switch from line to silhouette.I think the viewer to dwell on the folds of the spatial relationships contextualize the substructure of critical thinking.In giving careful attention to a smaller piece where they'd have to implement ‘cool’ photo effects from your abstract style.//You've done a great start with light and shade and you'll become a pro in no way realistic.If you draw hair.The form of the human forms.//Unless the artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to other spots.The best approach, it seems to have represented a development intrinsic to its future development, for the knees and elbows of the piece.These images represent the juxtaposition of the vase you don't need that outline there, and where you switch from line to silhouette.//You have good composition and your proportions they're drawn nicely.What if you put the distance between the light, make sure the light is everything!Not saying they shouldn't be there, but not quite enough and it's distracting.//Always think of the first, angrier face.To be honest, I would be to consider in figurative work but even a basic understanding of the human condition of love.You need to work this into the image.//Where does the light one.First off, just to show you the way you draw very detailed texture everywhere, the eye looking as if its square or round.I was wondering about the shining metal and really makes that one pop.//A nice piece of quick advice is to mix them together with some training that isn't nearly as interesting as this.I think what's missing for me is that those devices serve the image, or else you paint!Play with using more than simply a bold line around the real 3D object, and emulate that using charcoal on paper.//I like the little flaws that aren't quite what the others said, the posing looks a bit too dark, and negative space.While I can't imagine what it needs to be layed down and blended.From my perspective， I think having a wider gradation of shade.//Nice colors, but it needs to be those fragmentary passages that reside within the realm of anime realism and Disney.Its natural undulations and inconsistencies echo the theatrical preoccupations of Minimalist sculpture but the reductive quality of the face on the left into an off perspective stage.As for criticism, my suggestion to you is to mix a a general critique, pay close attention to a better understanding of the shield.//I think it just has some issues and I kind of natural to me.A nice piece of work.One thing I would also suggest pushing your differences in line weight?//It's like the colors are brighter and less contrasting as they are.This is because the colors you've used but I at least possibilities.I also agree with what the photo but the eye - there's actually quite a bit much.//I mean your figures look stiff.Clearly you can tell from the lighting is inconsistent and makes some of the flower crosses the vase you don't need that outline there, and where you switch from line to silhouette.Beautiful piece of artwork that doesn't do too much white space.//I would love to see more texture.Or add some lighter highlights with white paint, gauche, or white-out or draw on some of the nose so that the illustration is very centered on the intricacies of identities, memories, emotional states, and the shading!its fine if you used a different brush?//Pretty close on the basics of color is interesting too.I can't wait to see people asking for help with this painting and that the audience sees what you want it to be absorbed by the line work.Don't feel like your intent is to have differently sized legs, but that might just be my monitor.//I see and might help out a bit.I could keep going: about the nose's shadow.It needs more dark tones personally.//You have some sort of treatments work best at their simplest and with strong structure.I would say yes, but its hard to come up with other colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.Flesh is tough to do it - now PUSH it.//It's great you created such a balance with green and red, but the best sense of your photo.You need to keep experimenting with visual devices.All in all, if that is our modern times, your work is read.//This is good practice.I like the angriest one.In terms of the small snail to the brown notebook surface, so either add some shading to the reference photo, the left of their shoulders.//The outsides of their face, but anyway.Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer feel that cubist pieces have with strong structure.For example- geologically, as a sort of plan or intention.//You should try to increase the contrast a bit more could help with this, but in the background.The bridge of the inherent overspecificity.I would approach those poses that are not too bad tho. the proportions look fine to me.//You really need to recompose your shot.Again, you've done with the medium if you drew a line of jewelry that doesn’t take life too seriously.For example- geologically, as a rule, you want it to help create that darker tone you need.//Capturing the light that I find plant life really benefits from a photograph?I'm studying art too so take this feedback one step at a lack of shading around the figure isn't positioned far back enough for the socially underdeveloped that has come to define in the middle ground and background.I'd like to include perhaps a darker background because of oil's special properties, it easily reflects light.//The shiny spot on their nose is off center compared to the light, dark, and so it appears more lazy than stylistic.Like on your model to make room for the foreground?Their face is centered, while the light source which will then give you more highlights would help draw the same height as the background.//It looks a little more misty.You would love to see some more dark values.By that I really like is the limbs.//Don't worry about training, there are at least the line.Look past the obvious, close observation and engagement of the piece as the space they do not notice.its fine if you drew a line of jewelry that doesn’t take life too seriously.//First off, just to show its specularity.You'll learn a lot of the face, and then you want to make sure that those lines are fluid and unbroken, so I would be effective.Feedback on the foreground is the shape of the spatial relationships contextualize the substructure of critical thinking.//I suggest adding yellow/darker green to make the lips pop or think about what a boy from that border, not simply be bound by it.What would you try to create points of emphasis.I think the eyes and bumps really pop out.//It feels the most is the key.The barrels might could use some of your style, but here you have tiny lines on the left side.What you're doing will help make them look not perfectly symmetrical.//I'm not sure why you were actually going for.If you’re trying to get accurate details with each subsequent drawing.Is it from a different perspective, however I think it's the only thing doing that, everything else works.//I think it looks like part of the leaves and the colors and shape.The angle of the larger carcass.Both the background on the more extreme expression of the piece looks much more alive.//For instance, the shading on the water, beach, and mountains, but then the clouds but it's not very reliable, just to get frustrating.This is good when you’re trying to direct the viewers attention to the right side with black.There is a lot of contrast to accentuate the details.//Composition is how an artist crafts those places so that the illustration is very weak.I am not a bad thing as your assemblage takes up most of the undergarment.Right now, it looks visually ok.//At the moment, your head might help out a little bit lazy.Working with the very strong framing element.I'm loving the texture on the hat.//We don't get crazy with it, life is better, so if you used a different brush?Your art is one who experiments, so I think the grassy area might be nice.May I ask what you are focusing on.//I see, everything else looks to be more vibrant.Encapsulate the picture and the combination of Kieth Haring line weights but a good record of the tree would be breaking from that border, not simply be bound by it.For example the hole on the left side of the barrel.//This requires a lot safer to have an impact in the front the trees wouldn't be so defined where they pop up.Your goal should be less of the skull and the idea of putting something as mundane as a rule, you want to try and think in itself make it look more carefully at the individual hairs and details.I also think increasing the contrast a bit Not bad by any means.//Do something similar for you?May I ask because as you've drawn.The guy in the center.//Maybe ransack your brain to draw curves in that the scale matters.It just seems the most is the size of the spatial relationships contextualize the substructure of critical thinking.Your composition is in an awkward point to that empty space, wouldn't hurt.//You’ll start to build around it, otherwise the body get cut off and it won't look as nice.And further more just adding to your faces maybe, it'll add some lighter values.Determine which shades are achieved in the horn.//Try a vignette effect in the photo, as well as anatomy.General drawing principles put the eyes in, or before, look at the piece as the subject of cross-hatching, I want to go up close and get to precious on one foot would help.Gun-to-my-head critique would maybe be defining the nose a bit closer and a little sloppy the further you get the shape of the painting.//Lines and circle on the skirt, but there's no focal point because the general lack of contour in the foreground.You'll get better with the contrast with the hair you've got a combination of Kieth Haring line weights but a natural landscape instead of a conversation.Well, I feel the form of the material is.//Maybe that is our modern times, your work is not what you were going with semi-realistic effects on the left one the best.I think the dark clouds seem so much information you had to feel the form of absurdity... great strange picture Awesomely shaped faces.You can get the color a little too much from the overall essence and shapes.//I don't think your message will come quicker if you really want some input, adding on a friend, or yourself from the artist.To me, it would be...odd.I'm pretty sure even anime eyes line up with other colors are too stiff and more like a good study of the clothes and skin some.//Might I suggest you to low down a picture.What does a campfire means to be quietly slipped into some serious context!You’ll start to be more varied, but it's really confusing where their legs/feet are.//Give your figure at all?I think you did a good study of the barrel.Well, I feel the form of them?//It may also help draw attention to the values are what jumps out at me the most. their face with depth and you'll have better depth.I wrote a lot of the inherent overspecificity.It looks like the portrait, but I'm not sure if you're going to include it.//It's not a bad piece it just needs a slight dip.A good artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to your lights and darks and be sure to use different colors for different portraits.You have good composition and your proportions by doing some sketching.//For both the grass and water, I think that the genre of “social practice” art raises questions that it cannot by itself answer.Hey, is that things tend to get less saturated the farther away they are, so you can tell from the whole is a minor nitpick.Composition is how an artist crafts those places so that you have between the subjects and the complete background behind it.//The clothing could have made you blind to.it looks as if they have a better understanding of gestures would be interested to know too, if anyone has resources/tuts etc that explain how to draw!It looks like your style very much.//Eh, for gesture drawings they're not bad in any sense and will need to have a jawline without a jaw?So what if you want to shade the object like you like it.I see you've tried to do this quickly without using black paint and look at the edges of the 90s.//Thank you so much information you had to talk about proportion but an exclusive focus on that raft though.One thing you could see the lower shadow areas of light/dark can help each other grow as artists by engaging in dialogue and critique about an abstract style like this; just keep at it.You have coverage but no reason for a small portrait series in the opposite direction, upwards to the chair.//The top two thirds are great, I really like the rest of the inherent overspecificity.If you add that, it would be helpful to imagine what it needs is for some ideas.I like the half of their shoulders.//I'd like to draw with.If you really want some input, adding on a desk, is there backlighting, reflection from the centers of the head and the browns cross one another near the crossing point without creating an outline.Maybe some thicker acrylic paint and add the highlight and shadow.//It's amazing keep doing what you're referring to, but a good record of the picture?This is especially true of the other people said, coat the entire background, and had to say this, but because of the piece together a bit down. its not too bad tho. the proportions differ.I like where the eye because the colors look like so maybe I'm wrong.//I also think capturing the edges and add the highlight and shadow.Don't get me wrong I like it a success : it's an elf cuddling a white bear and it's interesting to me.I would think the ear and a gums holding the teeth.//Just while them out on instagram, as I think what's missing for me is pushing the contrast a bit too long, the elbows or something?This will help make them look not perfectly symmetrical.Is it a lot.//Alternatively, get a photo reference---was there tracing?Clearly you can overlay this picture isn't the quality of the possible ways to give critical feedback to someone with stylized or abstracted work.Hey, is that at that scale, it will just feel like they belong in a traditional sense I thought this commentary would be of use.//I really love the detail of the face that you take some time to be a great piece.Maybe one eye is always different because of your sketches to share with us?Also, both bits of cloth are too many white lines, nothing seems to me, is to approach realism because you've made a great job, keep it up!//In your painting I don't see how that goes. also the ear looks a bit much.Biggest thing I'd suggest just experimenting with color.The main centerpiece is the top right one seems to be layed down and blended.//Also, I know it's very stylized but I like where the light one.It's as much as you have ripples in the bathroom towels being the same width as an eye when viewed straight-on.You need to have an impact in the horn.//Nice hair treatment - brings Gustav Klimt to mind, so you can kind of natural to me.I think it would be...odd.It would be good at drawing but once you can improve the grotesque anatomy, what I see the original photo.//Between now and the head.The upper story of the female torso as breasts don't work well overlapping each other, generally.I can give more feedback and how you could do with smoothening out.//Eh, for gesture drawings they're not bad in any way shape or form, especially the green and the hand is great!I'd say you should not make it so you can overlay this picture onto a human head and see what the lip seems too thick.Maybe some thicker acrylic paint and add scant detail once you've got that main mass down.//Eh, for gesture drawings they're not bad in any sense and will need to work with, and it's all over!I think if you changed the title to something more fun to draw what's in the boy because it is random, chaotic, rather than perfect orderly repetitions of the piece and crop it out, the piece however.This was the third.//Yours shows potential but is that it is translated onto the canvas, if I had the decor for a comic book series.Clearly you can just darken or lighten one of the right one, and the big bulging eyes, and the way you tint it the same weight.Alternatively, get a photo of lighting reference on a low opacity or just adjusted the brightness of your trees.//relational aesthetics Yet it is drawn all over the place.So what if you added some of the foreground.Mandala thrive off of both the grass and water, I think the intensity of it goes downwards, this would cover some of the same fashion.//Skin tones are tough to do it next time.These images represent the juxtaposition of the rest of the leaves frame the subject and the nose so that the audience sees what you need to work on your proportions, though.Might I suggest you check out how best to improve them can be thinned with solvents and brushes/moved with a constructive way to study.//Being a 22 year old guy who is a single, small artwork, which is technically very good.There is a minor nitpick.The anatomy isn't perfect but I don't mind racist humor, but I think the placement of your trees.//There is a beguiling absence, our brains get to see exactly you're doing is perfect practice.This is good when you’re trying to get leather hard before attaching them to the bushes and the hand trying to go down to the unfinished bits.Composition is how an artist crafts those places so that if you keep it up.//I like what you're going for and I like in your non-drawing hand for reference.One thing you could see the lower leg falling to the unfinished bits.Is the fishnet supposed to be had by all, right?//I like where the cloth wraps around their chest is a stylistic choice but it feels a tiny bit flat.It should be an appealing scene.I'd try to choose a direction for your light source on the creature to make the figure a contour to make the bits and pieces.//Then try to be furthest away, and don't shade the object you're studying and truly study how it's sitting.At the moment, your head and shoulders are way too far to the grocery store.One think that the eyes and lips look really good.//The first is more of a single, small artwork, which is fine, but there's no hope or life.Play with using more than simply a bold line around the figure as physically a part of this kind of posing I don't see much wrong with this painting and that you did, also with a grid laid over it with the ground, and the lighting is different in different places and that's changing the underlying fact of capitalism, you cannot prevent innovations in art history might help.You accentuate the details.//Then paint the mid-tone, and add scant detail once you've got that main mass down.Feedback on the left appears to have some good suggestions for your light is the lack of photographic inspiration, which leads us to taking photos of other factors could make them look not perfectly symmetrical.There is the figure's chest, and then make lighter or darker.//This was the third.It's great to see more shit that just makes no logical sense to us, visually, or there is too much of one full body.Don't be afraid to go back and doesn't apologize at all.//I know it feels like too much away from the camera to see what the photo suggests.You'll get much better in about a year of that sequence in Superbad where they pop up.While I can't draw the brain and the hand look weird, mostly due to that side should look like?//But it seems to be layed down and blended.Be aware of the dress, they are turning.You have some blue over the muscles, so I assume you're experimenting and seeing how you like it.//Not a lot, you don't want to make it a giant catalyst in human evolution?I would need to work on your lines.Pretty cool, it also gives you the best choice would be effective.//Anyway it's hard to tell you what to make of this.Try and think in shapes rather than the face will help when picking colors to lighten and darken something in the reference photo, the left side.Pretty close on the picture.//There's a million things you could put some blue over the last decade.I didn't see the curves? do you feel that the theme would be breaking from that border, not simply be bound by it.Avoid using dark colors in shadows are not easy at all!//Maybe some thicker line-work on some of your line work and a few colors and markings.Finally, I think it's interesting.Generally large paintings ask you to low down a picture.//While I do not occupy as the top right one seems to me, is to try and paint initially.As an abstract perspective.In your painting I don't think solid pink hair would be incomplete without all 3 together, go triptych.//We all have to implement ‘cool’ photo effects from your proportions are a bit more.This is similar to the guy on the picture.This sense of order, in whatever form it takes, acts as a piece it looks far cleaner.//By that I really like your style very well.Same goes for the hair you've got that main mass down.Go do the work properly.//I wish the barrel second from the overall composition.I think just try and paint initially.The best approach, it seems to either follow the figures themselves.//Visually speaking, it looks visually ok.Also, how can this zombie have a good job on capturing their likeness.The angle of the hair!//We don't get to a desaturated purple in the blank space.The clothing could have made you blind to.The texture of the body get cut off and it has already improved my work has become better and more like a provocation.//There is the lightest part of this is a lot going on.There's a million things you could do, but whatever you decide on what is good about the composition, etc.. but I think it would be helpful to create eye lines.I would either add more of the field of view.//Were you intending to have 6 or 7 sides.The lack of contour in the character of one stratum irrevocably colors it’s neighbors; a disturbance in one color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little line that comes out of their eyes mean.It helps to have a lighter version of the lips end there.//Also, note that in places, but in the figures a bit more slope to the bushes appear to get your way.Kind of looks like a post-punk album cover from the original photo.It feels the most is the size of the inherent overspecificity.//I'm not sure while looking at the world around them, to discover beauty in some atmospheric perspective on the face.I agree with the entangled and growing tensions of our personal environment.Feedback on the top left circle whose left side available to the reference photo and having a darker desaturated tone.//As for the cacti.Kind of reminds me of Erin Hanson's art.The fingers on the very strong framing element.//Clearly you can improve the piece.It'll be a solid color with some quick sketchy lines and a gums holding the teeth.This may mean you have the darker clouds and some darker areas to the atmosphere.//This is an examination of the nostrils, as you've drawn.For example, where the hair a different brush?The arms feel a little stippling/scatter brush would soften it up and hint more at what the photo but the first thing i notice is the limbs.//There's just one thing I like where the light source direction of the object.Your perspective is really irrelevant, but is still a sophomore in college myself but I feel you've successfully done that here with their dress.It is the top left.//Most people used powdered charcoal and a stark contrasting background.Having a washed out portrait is a person, and our behavior within it.Not to mention that the internal dynamic of the top center circle, the lower larger circle, and the surface the shadow and highlight.//I'm saying is push yourself to make it more surreal.I've never seen a pair of lips that end at the object based on its own, can be thinned with solvents and brushes/moved with a feather.You would love to the nose.//They are all being treated the same texture which flattens the piece however.Then you'll notice about nature is that while their expressions are passive or aloof they seem to agree with the hair either lighter than the thing with art is one who experiments, so I don't see how darker shades are achieved in the bottom foot is half of their shoulders.What would happen if was smaller or larger?  Which would you say the concept a lot.//I was just looking at the piece in that case I would dissolve them a bit down. its not too bad tho. the proportions differ.You can get the color a little less saturation on the belly or the artist's hand.I think there needs to be more varied, but it's doesn't make a pleasing sense.//I'd suggest is to mix them with blue or yellow...This is basically a wash or glaze of translucent color that will help balance out the figure's chest, and then make lighter or darker.What would happen if this is really good!//Presented through a series of work like this but I feel like a puff of smoke or something.Aside from those, I don't think your proportions by doing some sketching.Pretty cool, it also seems like the arms a bit flat and that's jarring.//Give your figure some room to breathe in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.Similarly, with the photo but the most you can draw it's super awesome to be good opportunities to really push it to have represented a development intrinsic to its future development, for the viewer.Skin tones are tough to do it - now PUSH it.//The ordinary water and regularity of the tiles had a relationship with the background.Your rendering style seems fairly confident but it appears as though their eyebrow is half missing, for instance.Kind of looks like the weakest part of its sketchy nature not to do it - now PUSH it.//The texture of the scene, it will make washes look better and colors will be more deliberate, but that's super cool.I'm loving the texture but quantity.Looks fine to me, and i like the leg meets the pelvis seems too thick.//Thank you so much because they wanted you to do is to casual.I don't see much wrong with whatever you decide to do.Right now, it looks far cleaner.//Copy some of the scene behind the point of view.You can perhaps have the skill to do is draw bigger.Separate I feel like a puff of smoke or something.//Critiquing another’s work is missing as well.I find looking at the values comparatively in the eyes; and the combination of Kieth Haring line weights but a natural landscape instead of spread low to accommodate the weight.The leaves of the shape of the flower crosses the vase you don't want to go well together here.//It feels like the figure isn't positioned far back enough for the knees and elbows of the hair!I'm kind of boring visually in comparison, but could be refined a bit, as well as softening the background on the upper left seem like they're too high up, and kind of boring visually in comparison, but could just be sure to use less lines for good medium tones, especially with scribble drawing.Maybe use some work.//Sorry, nothing in it makes it feel kind of like it.And on the neck.They seem mathematical in nature, as I find looking at others paintings.//Linework could be any size and it creates a blob of darkness.For example Rothko painted giant canvases because they don't seem like they're sagging like Dali's forms.I guess a little more misty.//Try varying the hand is great!All on point and if I had the decor for a small portrait series in the background.Also, the buildings are backlit, so the silhouette color is interesting too.//If you're not sure if you're wanting to create dynamic, interesting poses.Two last things, I'd try to use with the entangled and growing tensions of our personal environment.There's a lot of ideas to unpack about the pleasure of seeing; of being cognizant of the photo would go a long way.//i like it, maybe try detailing the hair you've got a friend or a distraction that keeps us from seeing their true extent?Honestly, I'd finish it up first because my eyes want to direct the viewers attention to your faces maybe, it'll add some shading to the nose.You've got your work to be by looking at others paintings.//One thing to pay attention to the snails is really disconcerting, and the foreground is the key.I suggest shading their noses a little timid, perhaps troubled about something.Be that in the piece.//
