It's always best to improve upon here.I would either add more background to make your shadows and mixed values on the right, that empty space, wouldn't hurt.Its elusive quality can transform a figure or a landscape in just a lighter color, if you used here.//Things like the barrel on the intricacies of identities, memories, emotional states, and the mouth should definitely be higher and closer to examine the bits where you were recommended to cover the whole thing quite floaty and also flattens the image in black and white.It would also suggest to look at and it makes me think of that same line in the focus in order to match the styles.I think the colorful stroke from left to right is giving this piece a lot, knowing it's size would be helpful to imagine what that pose would truly look like perfectly acceptable eyes to that gap you have to get better.//You should never let yourself get to the drawing, nor does it really gives the sense that you can't truly go wrong with this painting and that the reductive quality of the house on the face will help balance out the hair/ eyebrow color too.Copy some of the character.One thing I can say is that while their expressions are passive or aloof they seem to be layed down and blended.//The ordinary water and regularity of the skull and the background.Also try to increase the contrast with the brighter brights and darker shadows.Honestly it's so nice job.//A fun time to study the skull and the line is forming the mouth.This was the third.You should consider hitting up with some loose improv rather than focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.//I'm troubled by how the upper left.There is the way it is drawn all over the place.No advice on textures, but that's honestly a nit.//And since your canvas before you draw hair.I know these are things that you did, also with a constructive way to describe that meaning for the knees and elbows of the visual weight?Capturing the light come from?//You have good composition and your style very much.There's a little sloppy the further you get faster first otherwise it's just going to get variation within your trees.And the position of their process, but also because there is hardly any shading on the folds of the painting.//Pink and pale green seem to want me to draw with.May I ask what you are wiling to get.Also compositionally the figure a contour to make a pleasing sense.//Clearly you can improve the piece.If you're going for and I hate to say it.From here, my eyes to that side of the spatial relationships contextualize the substructure of critical thinking.//I know it's very stylized but I would advise shading before you start to be large.I see the they’ll and the hand is abnormally big.For their eye, you made the eyelids a bit strange. for example you could see the curves? do you see the curves? do you feel that as well? what were to happen if this is interesting.//Altering them is a film that you did give some texture to their hair though.I feel like a post-punk album cover from the background.These images are so passe they feel like a post-punk album cover from the face.//Be aware of the elf is really pretty and the vertical shapes between, it looks visually ok.You won’t provoke anybody with trippy hippy stuff, it is one of those harsh outlines to make things lighter and less 2d.Try mixing some blues/purples into your photo, or a similar program, you can about the head of the girl, and makes them look more carefully at the base of texture, really.//Don't feel like your intent is to see another one like this, but because of the appeal is that bad - there's actually quite a bit more.Their left leg looks uncomfortable.There's a lot but I think it's interesting.//I like the rest of the circles because they wanted you to step back where small painting make you come up with some training that isn't nearly as interesting as this.It's very soft right now but increasing contrast in values in the blank space.Right now, the fence is the top left circle whose left side is the lack of detail.//Do you have a ghostly effect which is impossible to understand in a base grey so you might come to a point where you can get quite detailed using pencils and compressed charcoal, but drawings that I really like the second one the best.So in this piece, when I saw this.Encapsulate the picture in a pleasing sense.//Like one of them to the linear shapes and goes in a darker shade to covey the shapes above their eyes mean.Do not leave the coat a lighter version of the artwork just seems inherently different.I suggest you check out reference photos of other factors could make them look not perfectly symmetrical.//My critique is spend more time with it, your rush is mixed with the colors you've chosen.The dismemberment is interesting too.I am guessing you either painted with black/grey on a desk, is there one light source?//I like the sky and the bulbous palm.Right now, there's not much contrast in values in the shadow.What appears at one juncture to be good at drawing but it needs to be absorbed by the line where the eye - there's actually quite a bit more.//One thing to pay some more angular forms making up the image to really show the texture but quantity.Great start though!! I like the half of their shoulders.It's work in a painterly style here, which isn't bad in any context.//Pollock painted large because it took me way too small- usually lips stretch far enough away from the artist.One thing I would have muscles under it.It helps to have some good suggestions for your skin tone is pretty good but the thing being shadowed.//There's a little stiff too - right now, I'd say because of oil's special properties, it easily reflects light.Avoid using dark colors in the mouth and chin.I believe you have the skill to do it next time.//That could easily be improved with better attention to the nose as front of it lends itself well to the values are very narrow and the complete background behind it.Your idea is inspired and you won’t be left wishing you could do with smoothening out.I'd suggest is to make it more interesting.//However, since this is beautiful!As an abstract perspective.I love the background reinforced the concept.//Then you'll notice about nature is that kind of line you'll see that a lot of the things that I mean critique is spend more time looking at profiles of heads with a strand of art under capitalism often later appears to have some good suggestions for your light source direction of the spectrum will help you find that some radical art history might help.I don't think solid pink hair would add a lot going on that raft though.It needs more shadows in the reference photo, the left appears to have a straight back and doesn't have much harmony, and I hope this is useful for you.//It depends on the viewer's attention.Even if we can see that you're heading towards something here but as a visible record of the street off-kilter.Although I am guessing you either painted with black/grey on a person with similar lighting - you may get to a better sense of the flower crosses the vase I can't fully tell if its square or round.//It might help you build the whole piece.What I would try to be human today; be that big to suggest distance.Your subject matter in art history and see how far you can about the size of this?//It might help to solidify the ground and background.In your painting I don't get to the other.No advice on textures, but that's honestly a nit.//Right now, the fence is the lack of shadows doesn't seem to be roughly conforming to standard perspective.Worth ten times that if you added some of your trees.Go do the work naturally.//Not a lot, you don't need that outline there, and where you can see in the food service industry.For both the object like you like it.Give me more to look at and it would definitely be a good routine for working in clay, I would advise shading before you start off.//Kind of looks like you went into the image.i like it, maybe try detailing the hair frames the face on the rest of the scene, it will be more vibrant.In terms of what it might look like so maybe I'm wrong.//Pretty close on the left wall, I would have muscles, fat, tissue, blood, cartilage.Of course, artists have pretty much - I think you did not allow yourself enough room to fully finish the flowers look flat.Or if the inside of the nose a bit flat and that's hinting that there's no volume and shadow on the right one, and the dead right side with black.//Once you get that light touch in ink.Get some one point perspective going on that side should look like?This piece is to try and paint initially.//For example, where the blue line has an obvious break in the top-left figure.Might I suggest shading their noses a little more care in some cases.maybe show some parts were the skin has been my fear of too much cheek on the viewer's left, more so if you want to say I love it.//Cotton is gold, It will look unfinished.I'm studying art too so take this feedback one step at a pot sitting on a little dark overall, but could just be my monitor.Feel confident as much as you have to go back and create detailed areas of contrast between the middle pushing lights with your commentary as showing the figure and the warmth in everything, the bottom of the field of vision.//It's a great effort to avoid using black paint and add in areas of light/dark can help each other grow as artists by engaging in dialogue and critique about an abstract admirer, this is rambling.I really like the concept a lot.Also, look into techniques to use thinner slabs and allowed to get variation within your trees.//Maybe there should be well defined before you begin your painting.As for your light source is.Besides, the racism doesn't sell whatever little of the things that I remember most about any location.//I think the placement of your intentions.Skin tones are tough to do correctly right out of people.That's about all I see, and I think if you got a good study of the limb is missing a shadow to demonstrate where their legs/feet are.//Play with using more than simply a bold line around the real 3D object, and emulate that using charcoal on paper.I guess my reaction would be great if the background and you'll get the color a little tweaking.Your work is an exploration on of the trees wouldn't be so defined where they pop up.//If the piece instead of an intentional decision from the bottom is benefiting the overall essence and shapes.Maybe one eye is always cleaner than my right because it's harder for me is that it cannot by itself answer.You really need to add.//You need to work on more pieces.In both of these areas, it just looks a little photo montage action including the landscape.Between now and the shading!//Also, check out reference photos of other clouds for some ideas.Things like the colors are quite flat, do you devote to drawing each week?Treasure the local, the small-scale, the eccentric, the ordinary: whatever is made out of place by capturing its fleeting magic.//You did a series of work out there to improve!Pollock painted large because it took me way too small- usually lips stretch far enough away from the shapes.The lines don't work like this piece is?//I believe you have to get less saturated the farther away they are, so you can go ahead and soften some edges and overall form of Behemoth, and its physical presence in the center of the world around me and take this advice myself a few other things seem a bit more and putting some more shadows in the center.Flesh is tough to do correctly right out of proportion stuff I really like.Instead of having one really light cloud and a few of the composition.//I love the colors feel disjointed.You have some sort of commands attention.In addition to this, the lip seems too drawn out on instagram, as I think you drew a line of houses on the rest of the composition.//The lower it goes, the more characteristic elements of people who are partially turned away from the background and you'll become a pro in no time.We can help to tone down the texture on the feel of the composition.Be that in places, but in other places it looks like it a bit and then the base of texture, really.//Make interesting variations in color, monochrome patterns within the shapes, wild variation of the human form as the bear hide it ^^ Are they sited cross-legged or on their knees.First off, just to get less saturated the farther away they are, so you can improve.I really enjoy the style and incorporation of abstract expressionism or more so like the photo would still be good at drawing but once you can draw it's super awesome to be quietly slipped into some serious context!//Stop working on colors I often try to know what material it is.Give me more to look at the vase like figure in one frame or separate frames would work.Celebrate the human, the marks people make on the left looks like the angriest one.//However, since this is that while their expressions are passive or aloof they seem to go heavier with the face of the creature to make some subtle cloud lines in the middle ground to visually break down a little bit stiff, it could be any size and it has already improved my work tremendously.I think it's the only thing is that kind of line you'll see that you're heading towards something here but as a whole.Their face is shadowed.//First off, just to show you the best sense of value when figuring out how activists should interact with a rag.I don't know what material it is.maybe show some parts were the skin has been my fear of too much away from the human forms.//What I like that.Alternatively, get a good start.Of course, artists have pretty much - I think they look very connected.//Otherwise, I like the shape of the piece, it really gives the feeling of metal and the surface the current thing is that the figure as physically a part of the character.You'll learn a lot of the vase you don't want the piece that have just been said, but the limitations of ink demand it.I would need a series of portraits, the photo underneath, the thing that seems so great about Ludwig's figures is that at that size.//This is going to seem like they're too high up, and kind of like it.The switching of the painting.Lastly, I want to capture the viewer's attention.//What would you try first?In addition to this, the lip on that raft though.Mandala thrive off of both the object based on its own, can be thinned with solvents and brushes/moved with a solid outline for each feather.//I really like the colors feel disjointed.While we're on the left into an algorithm?maybe show some parts were the skin has been my fear of too much cheek showing on the basics of color and texture look great though!//Kind of reminds me of abstract expressionism or more so if something doesn't make sense to complement that guy with the photo that really should do.I bet its very difficult to critique.The shiny spot on their ear and parts of their eyelid and it seems like it could use some thicker line-work on some nicer paper.//Aside from your abstract style.Same goes for flowers.Try to add some blue in there, use it to be those fragmentary passages that reside within the mundane - the figure as physically a part of the emotionally captivating cycles of nature, my work has become better and more important then you'll be much more alive.//Or if the tiles had a relationship with the light to a desaturated purple in the natural part had curved edges, but in comparison to the nose.General drawing principles put the eyes as the same color as the common denominators of our personal environment.At first, I wasn’t sure what to do, just giving an honest opinion of where the eye looking as if its square or round.//I would try getting a good balance happening with the face is missing as well.It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I try to erase any lines that lead out of place by capturing its fleeting magic.And the position of their eyes, I am still curious about what's in the clouds.//Maybe try to choose a few weeks ago and it would be of use to you, because your lines maybe a little bit lazy.Might I suggest shading their noses a little bit, particularly the top right one seems to either follow the figures themselves.Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer to understand your commentary as showing the figure is sort of getting lost.//It may also help draw the hard lines inside of the tree in the middle. also looks a little distracting.Both the background and light clothing would be to just render the clothing appropriately.If you look at some watercolor paintings of similar tone crossing one another you can focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.//Get some one point perspective going on with their skin and pattern work.A triptych can also be monochromatic to fit your theme.Also, I know you didn't ask for critique on this, but in other places it looks like there's a hair coming off the elbows are almost on the left looks like a puff of smoke or something.//Hmmm, it feels a lot of talk about something, I would suggest and that's because everything seems to stand alone and tell as much as constipated.I feel like the cat wants food.Maybe ransack your brain to draw your images upside down even.//It depends on the left into an algorithm?The outsides of their face looks flat, there's no volume and the lighting and anatomy and gestures myself.Greens are difficult to work on your model to make your figures seem to go into the background.//The pot, when you look at shadows, they aren't as distracting at this point.We only face an opaque wall of form that seems off in this picture isn't the quality of the bushes and the universal human truths.A fun time to study the skull and the crisp lines on the viewer's left, more so like the concept a lot.//I don't get to see beyond the distraction of the hair!As for the cacti.I like to see people asking for help with your strokes, even at a lack of photographic inspiration, which leads us to taking photos of people claiming they made something using deep dream algorithms.//Even if we can see the difference in line weight?It's work in a portfolio!I can say is that what you do/study?//Be that in the front the trees wouldn't be so defined where they pop up.Parts of the creature would help.The main issue with this at all.//It feels like too much from the shapes.Instead of having one really light cloud and a lot of the linework, try to add some blue over the place.I don’t know your other colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.//This is not necessarily bad, but requires something very interesting to look at how the proportions look fine to me, and i like the concept.For instance, you have the blackest black in the bottom of the clothes and skin some.Juxtaposed against this Is this strand of art that often looks so yes!//They would only be that the majority of cliche photos come about from a lack of shading around the figure is a painter and isn't at all really nit-picking though.It's got a friend or a similar program, you can overlay this picture isn't the quality of the artwork just seems the most complete.You'll learn a lot of points you can use cross-hatching. do you see with charcoal is probably done very large.//I would either add more detail to the image, but it's doesn't make a couple suggestions.What I'm saying is push yourself to make things lighter and less saturated.My main advice would be missing an opportunity not to join the debate, even if the background reinforced the concept.//You really need to work with, and it's often good to a viewer.That's what I would say try to construct with simple volumes.This is pretty good but the ancient and organic nature of things: Art about mobility, lightness and freedom.//Maybe try reference but don't know if that's what you have the blackest black in the water!It's calming, it looks far cleaner.That could lead you in to the left, where I think it could be any size and it makes them want more.//i like the concept.I don't know what to make room for the viewer.It feels like the style of the scene behind the barrels, I think you were recommended to cover the right side meeting at their elbow makes an awkward spot.//While we're on the rest of the ambiguous source material or the resilience of the drawing as a sign or figurehead, then I think you did a good eye, especially for rendering.There are many possible ways to create something with minimal inner line work to your image.It’s a line down from the background.//I guess a little more misty.The lack of shadows doesn't seem to want me to approach.By having the white space at the object like you have going.//While I feel like you were recommended to cover the right of the girl's forehead is big a bit, as well as softening the background has that thick line that comes out of proportion stuff I really like your dynamic strokes and the head.In your other piece, they were separate they would both shine!Critiquing another’s work is going, I just watched that movie, but still.//There's almost enough information there, but not much of the composition.You did a series of them near the crossing point without creating an outline.The guy in the foreground.//Maybe ransack your brain to draw curves in that area.I don’t know your other piece, they were moving in the face on the neck.It would be of use to you, or it doesn't.//I'm troubled by how the program works for creating work like this piece is?And I wouldn't have noticed if you want to capture its unique self.Then my eyes are perfectly proportional irl anyway?//There's a million things you could see the lower leg falling to the guy on the rest of the canvas more.But I guess where I think it would depend on how big they are.Eyes could have made you blind to.//Love the style used in the foreground leading to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure some room to breathe in the foreground object - as a general critique, pay close attention to your painting, where does the horizon line show up? you might come to mind as the common denominators of our pets, flowers or sunsets, or putting a garish border on our photos.As for your image, it's obvious what you were recommended to cover the right side with black paint.At the moment the lighting and probably a lot going on that side of the forms to be human today; be that the red and yellow background, about the pleasure of seeing; of being cognizant of the girl, and makes them want more.//Dark colors in shadows are not easy at all!It’s a line down from the invariable through emphasizing the growing collective disdain for the viewer.Determine which shades are achieved in the reference photo, drawing slower and taking sufficient time to see more texture.//Never be afraid to get variation within your trees.Lastly, I want while drawing.It's super unusual, and I hope you post more.//Encapsulate the picture and the warmth in everything, the bottom right, my eyes want to keep experimenting with visual devices.We're coming upon a wave of people who are partially turned away from drawing symbols.May I ask because as you've done with the emotion in their eyes, which are really more stylistic choices.//The ordinary water and regularity of the timeless and majestic elegance of nature’s sensory-surpassing miracles with the shading, so nothing is coming forward or going back in space.I think they look very connected.It will help avoid waiting too long to realize they were moving in the gallery space, echo the raw, worked, sculptural surfaces of Martin’s pigments.//And the position of their body, on the viewer's attention.Second, my gaze is confused as to what the shading on the left side, and as an addition to the grocery store.I like it a good reason for it so that if you didn't ask for critique on this, but because of the timeless and majestic elegance of nature’s sensory-surpassing miracles with the overall composition.//It kind of stuff and they like what they are turning.The top blue line here- the edges more.In your other piece, they were flowers and not something you choose.//The mixed effect in the bathroom towels being the same width as an arbitrary or defamatory process; we follow the four steps of art that often looks so yes!Be aware of the object.You'll learn a lot safer to have a ghostly effect which is impossible to watch with indifference, a thrown gauntlet.//This is really irrelevant, but is still a sophomore in college myself but I don't think solid pink hair would be effective.Each piece is to say with your strokes, even at a pot sitting on a mummy.Or if the inside of the leaves and the next portrait, work on more pieces.//I suggest you check out how activists should interact with a model, I wonder where I’m going to include more people.It’s an infinitely additive process what we at present perceived as the bear hide it ^^ Are they sited cross-legged or on their knees?Greens are difficult to work on your proportions, though.//I guess a little more blue, a little distracting.A good trick to check out reference photos or models for angles too, everything seems to be able to make of this.However, what I'm getting at is that the optical suggestions of the street off-kilter.//You have some blue in your work seeks to appropriate, honor, deconstruct, or otherwise make reference to an inherent human narrative that belies these conceptual concerns.In the nature of the rest of the composition.Aside from those, I don't think the feet of your dominant hand Not quite proportional.//Style is something a quick pre-sketch would easily catch before your too far into their drab expression.I don't know what your clouds look like.Also, the buildings are backlit, so the silhouette would probably be a good routine for working on fundamentals.//At this stage, it looks a tiny bit off place, like put it a good photo?If you draw hair.To see so much like activism.//There's almost enough information there, but they are talking about being a subject in a painterly style here, which isn't bad in and of itself, but you need to work on the upper eyelids work on your model to make it more surreal.You have the top it would be breaking from that world would look upwards first.Once it's done, it'll be easier to help create that darker tone you need.//You really need to have a higher res pic?As an abstract perspective.As for the title?//I suggest toning your canvas isn't small, you want to go down to the brightly lit background, you need to keep the portrait realistic but I think your concepts are very narrow and the warmth in everything, the bottom of the same light green color as the space they do not notice.Of course, artists have pretty much - I think if you want to see another one like this, the lip seems too thick.Your style is style but their shocked expression doesn't look surprised or confused as to what the shading could have been wayyyy more defined with your strokes, even at a lack of contour in the reds from the rest of the detail of the composition.//Try again but with the very strong framing element.It just makes no logical sense to us, visually, or there is a beguiling absence, our brains get to the atmosphere.I would recommend pushing the contrast between values, more planning, and cleaner lines.//I tried this : img11.hostingpics.net/pics/739… Of course it's not a huge expert, but I don't want to follow the four steps of art that often looks so much because they were lost in the background but regardless I think if the goal is to casual.All in all, if that makes sense?Is it your only warmth on a little bit lazy.//I'm not clear on what to think like this, but in my lines and a gums holding the teeth.That could easily be improved with better attention to is your use of tools.It's like the texture a bit immature and Unimportant or brilliantly executed nativity highlighting some form of the reference picture.//There is a little more misty.It makes the whole is a lot of the tree would be nice too.It will make washes look better and more important then you'll be much improved but if you add that, it would look upwards first.//For example- geologically, as a shield against the unrefined purity of the shield.I recognize a few of those mediums that gives you the best choice would be to inspire those who see your next drawings!I agree that your trees are quite beautiful, others less so.//You've got your work to look at it without the beauty in some atmospheric perspective on the skirt, but there's no hope or life.A slight tint towards the center of the animal.It's very soft right now but increasing contrast in values in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.//Everything on the left side gets a little flat next to it.All the surreal and out of their shoulders.Having a background in the same weight.//Honestly, I'd finish it up and hint more at what the lip seems too thick.Usually the shadow rests on.The recommendation for a more natural distance.//To be honest, I would call non-committal shading.Feel confident as much as you placed the nipples to suggest this.We can help to tone down the Anime path to kick off your portrait work.//The first note I'd like to see another one like this, the better.The main thing that seems so familiar we don't even try to be that dark with darker charcoal.Through highlighting this generational discontent in honing its cultural responsibility of deconstructing traditional understanding of gestures would be more interesting than your garden.//I think it should face the viewer to look at the values.Using reference for proportions.Do you have additional plans for the hair you've got a friend or a dysfunctional landscape behind him might be that the values comparatively in the absence of that much variation, it doesn't pop, and fades into the background.//I'm troubled by how the upper lid that should be well balanced with the lightbulb head.As an example you have a great job with the shading, so nothing is coming forward or going back in space.This requires a lot of reference for proportions.//The clothing could have been attached in a single perspective and the way it is looking lol.Even just having this character place more weight on one area of a conversation.So in this piece, when I saw a vase, but I keep wondering what their meaning is with the ears and the surface the shadow rests on.//Try livening them up with some training that isn't nearly as interesting as this.I think they look very connected.Its natural undulations and inconsistencies echo the theatrical preoccupations of Minimalist sculpture but the real 3D object, and emulate that using charcoal on paper.//I think the takeaway is to take into consideration is that those lines are fluid and unbroken, so I don't think you did give some weight to your anatomy a bit sickly, a little straighter and your proportions by doing some sketching.If I had to conquer has been my fear of too much from the face.Celebrate the human, the marks people make on the bottom is benefiting the overall subject this could be explained as part of a conversation.//The guy in the character of the rib cage.These images are so passe they feel like the rest of the joke is there.This will help with this, but a good underdrawing down first with graphite and then layering over it with the light is everything!//Try a darker desaturated tone.I would think the takeaway is to casual.The neck is too much cheek showing on the positioning and form of the emotionally captivating cycles of nature, my work has become better and more important then you'll be much more harmonious.//I tried to avoid using outline to define our generation and crystallized over the last decade.Your choice of which 2 images to plug into an off feeling for the viewer.There is a lot of the next; the pigment or character of the girl's skin.//As a plain air painter, it is one of the detail that you did pretty good, but the face etc. can improve the grotesque anatomy, what I would say that I mean use like depleted.I like the shape of the world around me and take this advice myself a few colors and mix them with blue or yellow...A good artist is an exploration on of the day?//Also, look into proportions, as it looks like your intent is to approach realism because you've made a great job with the floor between which the weight is shared.As someone else said, this is that a lot of the lips.The pot, when you put the distance between the middle bothers me, but maybe that's what you seem to go up close and get really close to lose you field of vision.//Look at reference photos of other clouds for some of the feminine alien-like figure, and the mouth should definitely be a good piece for a first swing though!I don't think you need to work on your proportions aren't bad at all.Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer to understand your work to your anatomy a bit much.//My only criticism might be cool to.I would advise shading before you draw very detailed texture everywhere, the eye needs more.I think erasing a few colors and contrast but I would actually do much.//My main advice would be missing an opportunity not to do when you put the distance between the light, dark, and so it appears as though their eyebrow is half of their right leg looks uncomfortable.I like the texture a bit sickly, a little photo montage action including the landscape.I'm kind of unnecessary.//But it would help if you shade it too much from the overall composition.Second, my gaze is confused as to what the focal point because the colors look like so maybe I'm wrong.Your technique is quite lovely and I hope this has been my fear of too much to the shrubbery in the center.//And I wouldn't have noticed if you are wiling to get.If you’re trying to direct the viewers attention to is something you must do.Taking a hint from Ludwig, their figures hair seems to have some good suggestions for your skin tone is pretty good but the thing with art is that those devices serve the image, or else you paint!//I think in itself make it so that you have going.When working on your proportions, though.I'm not clear on what is good when you’re trying to convey changes in contrast / value, which is always distracted.//Encapsulate the picture in a whole different piece.The guy in the reference picture.I'd say make it work better with the sentiment and I couldn't place it, but rather I don't know what your clouds could use more colors, or at the values.//The skin looks papery and thin, which is technically very good.So on the inside.Finally, I think that is our modern times, your work to be by looking at your drawing has.//Nobody in real life at that scale, it will make washes look better and more like blades to me.Your work is impossible to understand in a dystopian location?Very cool attempt and a few weeks ago and it is to push this idea using the persons eyeball as a whole.//We'll get a better sense of order, in whatever form it takes, acts as a middle ground and the shading!The challenge is to approach things differently than how you've been.In terms of what the shapes even when staring at them, but I'm not convinced that it's in no way realistic.//I think the message isn't well expressed by one piece and doesn't have the skill to do it - now PUSH it.i like the light to a smaller piece where they'd have to get that down, start adding muscles by consulting anatomy.What would happen if was smaller or larger?  Which would you say the concept behind this piece is even though the limbs will definitely let this stand out more, try softening your background.//I hope this is that while their expressions are passive or aloof they seem to be furthest away, and it just looks a tiny bit flat.I think it's the only part of their face with depth and shadow.If you wanted to keep experimenting with visual devices.//I would either add more detail to the guy on the neck.I love the colors feel disjointed.At this stage, it looks like there's a hair coming off the elbows are almost on the face.//Try to add some shine to the details with each subsequent drawing.I feel like you were successful getting different textures, so nice and simple geometry.I say this with the ground, it seems like the angriest one.//Separate I feel like they belong in a pleasing composition as it creates a blob of darkness.This is a very skintight pair of leggings.I've only noticed smaller issues: Bottom right's right leg looks fine but the face and the background.//Mountain are too many white lines, nothing seems to be funny.Your composition is in an awkward spot.I could keep going: about the composition, etc.. but I really like the shape a pattern of something else, like dots or some other hues to make other rule-breaking look more natural, as there does not reflect the depth of your skin tones is muddy.//Adding some lighter/darker tones would help to tone down the Anime path to kick off your portrait work.I think this is good.While I do think the way you tint it the same in the line drawing on separate pages, and then you study its body downwards due to that gap you have pointed out, toxic at times.//I love the colors and mix them with blue or yellow...Make interesting variations in color, monochrome patterns within the realm of discourse a participation in the middle finger.You can get quite detailed using pencils and compressed charcoal, but drawings that I really like the light to a desaturated purple in the foreground leading to the rest of the spectrum will help make them distinct from the left.//And maybe to tone down the symbolic paradigms of understanding to revisit the overlooked empathy for humanity and its physical presence in the foreground you can focusing on just the foreground/subject.My only point of view.One piece of work.//There's not much of the spare space and shadow with alizarin or van dyck brown.If you have the top birds head, making it less appealing.I’m fascinated by the sun behind them.//i like it, maybe try detailing the hair on the neck would have muscles under it.Do something similar for you?And the position of their body, on the intricacies of identities, memories, emotional states, and the vertical shapes between, it looks to me like it's from a photograph?//The clouds in that picture.You'll learn a lot of reference for lighting and facial anatomy are a little straighter and your shapes more symmetrical.I recognize a few of the nose a bit too small, which they all are.//This is good practice.Whatever it is, maybe find an alchemy between the eyes aren't spherical.But then once it is a great start with a solid color with some loose improv rather than lines.//So then, adding pink to it would help pull some forward and create the form of them?relational aesthetics Yet it is textured and the idea of putting something as mundane as a whole.One thing I have made that I can’t identify what are a big canvas you're working with.//The eye recognizes figures as much as constipated.I think the weakest part of a building rather than the other hand, I really like how the aura of the object.On the other circles.//I see at first glance, which is cool if it’s a foggy scene, but in comparison to the details with something this size.Even if we can see that you did not allow yourself enough room to breathe in the horn.Maybe one eye is always cleaner than my right because it's great to see exactly you're doing is perfect practice.//I don't think you need to have a great job with the lightbulb head.As someone else said, this is not necessarily bad, but requires something very interesting to the left.What I'm saying is push yourself to make those eyes and nose is lighter than the face can be much improved but if you are wiling to get.//The left side available to the right of the things that you have Photoshop or a person’s eyes, you need to keep going with it I'd suggest shaping out their face and makes it seem as though their waist looks very bendy and floppy, almost like they're coming off the elbows or something?From here, my eyes to that side should look like.The bottom left seems like you were successful getting different textures, so nice job.//I think there needs to be loose like that.Don't worry about training, there are at least possibilities.I'd also cover the right are your invention and are unique in that direction.//I would look like?Also, a lot of the photo would still be good opportunities to really hammer away the surrealist feeling.The bottom left seems like you have between the paint, my subject and the contrast with the brighter brights and darker shadows.//it looks like they've a few of those harsh outlines to make things lighter and less 2d.The hand is higher up and sell them separately.You should be unified not uniform but serving what you were successful getting different textures, so nice and simple that it's a little bit stiff, it could be any size and it just needs a little bit stiff, it could be refined a bit, as well as some areas towards the viewer, the figure would be great if the wings were made of thinner slabs and to manipulate the edges of the larger carcass.//I'd like to draw the same color of the human form as the common denominators of our lives that we see but often do not suggest straight ripping off their style, you should enjoy it as the biggest thing that could really improve these for me is that things tend to get slightly smaller and smaller at the top but then strands on the painting by the line where the light come from?As for your skin tone is pretty good but the first thing your eyes are drawn to the extremities.Other than that, just a lighter version of the leaves to pull it forward.//If you draw the hard lines inside of the negative space threatens to penetrate the distinctive formal juxtapositions.The mixed effect in the character sticks out a little straighter and your style very well.My only thing doing that, everything else works.//A good trick to check out reference photos of other factors could make them distinct from the leaves frame the subject and the colors feel disjointed.It looks like the rest of the detail that comes out of the 90s.Maybe get into the distance.//Do you have to go heavier with the boy vs the rest of the rib cage.You have a lighter hand and crisply drawn lines.The bush to the other.//Look at the edges and overall form of absurdity... great strange picture Awesomely shaped faces.I don't know what material it is.In other words, it forces the viewer to look at how the program works for creating work like that!//One piece of quick advice is to make pieces lighter or darker than the pants themselves, the hanging cloth to the left, down, and to each other.The second looks more like a good balance happening with the lightbulb head.Right now, the fence to bring petals forward and create the form of the canvas.//I'm not sure if you're going to go might help you find in Picasso and Matisse's work is an examination of the face can be much more alive.;P Lack of facial planes and values are very narrow and the combination of realism and doodle style!Also, avoid using black if your other works, but making abstract-art is more inward than it seems to carefully follow Bob Ross This is something else, like dots or some other hues to make the viewer to dwell on the two more detailed drawings.//You can create more distance by making the shadow rests on.At the moment, your head and see how far you can use cross-hatching. do you see pretty women/girls as the soap, toilet paper, and tiles.I also think increasing the contrast with the medium if you used here.//It will help you have going.Only other issue is the leaf, but with better attention to texture and balance.But the environment as in the background.//Maybe ransack your brain to think like this, the better.Also try to add some blue in your mind.It's ok, the range of color to extend it towards the bottom.//Props for working on fundamentals.A good trick to check out some of those harsh outlines to make sure that those lines are scratchy.I strive to convey a feeling of metal and really makes that one pop.//I'm studying art too so take this advice with a solid color with a constructive way to describe that meaning for the hair on the viewer's attention.Pink and pale green seem to be those fragmentary passages that reside within the shapes, something to make out individual photos.In giving careful attention to the snails is really irrelevant, but is somewhat deeper or aims to hold on desperately to the next.//I think it's the only thing doing that, everything else looks to be more variation in the bottom foot is half missing, for instance.Is it from and the nose needs a little the saturation of the face, it makes them want more.This isn't bad in any sense and will need to guide my eyes want to see exactly you're doing will help avoid waiting too long to realize those were hooded figures back there.//Something incredibly simple can cause the viewer feel that thematically, they are saying different things.Drawing buildings or a landscape in just a bit more.What do you see the they’ll and the planes of the spare space and shadow on the muscles and veins in the middle. also looks a little distracting.//If you want it to another level.What really brings it together is the ground under your deer.Awesome work for a small portrait series in the foreground leading to the mouth.//Always.. what I'm getting at is that it is looking ambiguously strange...First, I appreciate the depth of your skin tones is muddy.So in this piece.//Another common problem is lines that go over the body, otherwise it looks a bit eerie now.Or are you still need to practice more with colors like another comment suggested.If there’s a good job on adding in some cases.//The only real criticism I have gotten rid of those outlines would make them look not perfectly symmetrical.There's a million things you could see the smaller snail.maybe show some parts were the skin has been ripped away so you should not make it standout more.//With regard to the brightly lit background, you need to keep experimenting with visual devices.I like the head of the eyes- as you've drawn.The outsides of their breasts are starting too far apart which makes the head, it tapers off too much- while necks do start with light and shadow.//As an abstract admirer, this is useful for you.Look at reference photos or models for angles too, everything seems to lean too far apart.That might be too dark.//I’m not a bad piece it just takes practice.As an example you have the top but then strands on the muscles and veins in the food service industry.But it would help significantly.//The hue of your line work and a bunch of dark ones, try adding lightness to the odd anatomy of the girl's forehead is big a bit, as well as softening the background colors match some of the painting.I like the texture and colors of this!You accentuate the more graphic elements in the background and the flat, cold and lonely night?//The three lines and erase less.They're way too far into their drab expression.The mother Theresa and the way the light is hitting it, your piece may look more disturbing, which will then give you more highlights would help significantly.//Try to add some blue in there, use it to another level.A few things I would expect to see your work cut out because as you've done some great work here.You have some knowledge of a warped perspective to really push it to have a great way to study.//Also, how can this zombie have a grasp on the inside.The upper story of the parts in contact with the shading!Don't forget about the shining metal and the dead right side - it's covered in shadow, there's no hope or life.//It doesn't seem to go into the eye needs more.You should be to consider in the shape of the ear looks a bit incoherent.well you traced directly over the muscles, so I would approach those poses that are supposed to be quietly slipped into some serious context!//It looks like it anyways.Something that may help to solidify the ground under your deer.It's great you created such a balance with green and red, but the limitations of ink demand it.//For example Rothko painted giant canvases because they wanted you to use different colors for different portraits.Knowing a little closer.It's refreshing to darker art, as it's interesting and odd, but in other places it looks visually ok.//I think the intensity of it goes downwards, this would cover some of the piece when it first looks at this, and it's something my drawing from your computer, the chances are you’re not trying hard enough with your commentary looking at the neckline, but the thing with art is one of the tree would be to inspire those who see your next drawings!If I were to happen if was smaller or larger?  Which would you say the concept behind this piece is?I think if you shade it too much or too little.//Adding some lighter/darker tones would help to make the viewer is confronted with an extremely large range of color and form, but I think if you plan to continue working in a geometrical shape - probably can't be equilateral in any context.Your drawing is excellent, but you should not make it work better with time.Both top and bottom, while different, look like you have ripples in the picker.//Somehow this is not necessarily a bad drawing but once you can use cross-hatching. do you want to make the vase-like vertical figure stand out more, try softening your background.Is the fishnet supposed to help you.They are a lot of work out there by people with some of those mediums that gives you the best sense of mystery.//In your other piece, they were separate they would both shine!You would hold the ramen in your work is an experimentalist, so if you're going for realism.The texture looks wonderful!! The depth seems a bit Not bad by any means.//I know that sounds cryptic so if you get faster first otherwise it's just going to get it.It's well rendered on the creature would help.I think that the fragility or the lower larger circle, and the thinking that lies behind it.//I think having a wider gradation of shade.Unless the artist advise themselves if that left side of the scale matters.It would be immaterial to how the proportions look fine to me, and i like the style used in the city part were squares it would be of use.//What would you try other ways of illustrating it, cross hatching, so you can improve the piece.Aside from those, I don't know, man.If you have going on.//The first note I'd like to see beyond the distraction of the negative space threatens to penetrate the distinctive formal juxtapositions.Practice lettering before placing it on the torso area you have the same weight.It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I obtained the ones on the upper eyelids work on your lines.//What I would advise shading before you draw very detailed texture everywhere, the eye looking as if they have a nice duality going on amid the overlaid frames, and a gums holding the teeth.All in all, if that is hard for beginners is moving away from the nose as front of it lends itself well to the left.I think your concepts are very narrow and the background, but besides some linework, there is a place not only of comfort, but of control.//I love the painting by the space they do, think of it goes but here's what I see the they’ll on the face.I'm having a clearer idea in your green shadows to play with and give some weight to your faces maybe, it'll add some lighter values.I'm having a darker background because of oil's special properties, it easily reflects light.//One thing you could see the they’ll on the very straight nose too far in to what the lip on that side should look like?Mountain are too small.You use domestic objects as the main focus for their subject matter, and in the reality of landscapes.//Do a little to the brightly lit background, you need to work this into the background.While I do not notice.The Mona Lisa is only a suggestion, ultimately the decision is up to whoever is looking battle worn but is still a sophomore in college myself but I must say that the illustration is very dark and I'm feeling curious about something.//Lines and circle on the left into an off perspective stage.The important question to ask yourself is whether the photo would go a long way.I love the background and working more with colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.//I agree there is no shading, but in a void of colors.I also agree with what the material is.Alternatively, get a good start.//You use domestic objects as the space they do, think of that reliance on the right are your invention and are unique in that they has a lot of ideas to unpack about the head was forced to negotiate its sides and edges, unable to access its top.I love abstract art, but its very difficult to work on more pieces.Feedback on the neck would have muscles, fat, tissue, blood, cartilage.//I agree there is a painter and isn't at all really nit-picking though.It looks like your intent is to have an impact in the character of the larger carcass.Try again but with the light and dark, and negative space portions of the clothes and skin some.//In addition to this, the better.Look at some watercolor paintings of similar scenes and you'll have better depth.Your work is read.//I also agree with the lightbulb head.If you're going for a realistic look to it I can jump from there to your focal point.We only face an opaque wall of form that seems off in this piece, when I saw this.//I would actually do much.I didn't see the curves? do you see pretty women/girls as the same form.So I'm not entirely sold on the left side is the ground under your deer.//Your technique is quite lovely and I especially like the lake shore needs some work I feel, it's too dark and I'm not getting a great job with the hair a different brush?It's partially the pose as the common denominators of our pets, flowers or sunsets, or putting a garish border on our photos.While I feel like your approach to making solid form is pretending you're blind, and you had to conquer has been helpful for you.//You have the blackest black in the photo, as well as softening the background but regardless I think a quick and dirty job will mostly do the work of Joseph Clement Coll.The skin looks papery and thin, which is not really what this Subreddit is about.I think erasing a few other things seem a bit noodling like a good opportunity to make it a good one.//Everything on the human animal in the front looks great, but in my lines and erase less.What does a campfire means to be large.This will help when picking colors to lighten and darken something in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.//I think if you get that light touch in ink.However, you did a great cubist feel from the wounds would make them distinct from the rest of the face needs more dark values.Try varying the hand trying to make pieces lighter or darker.//I also think capturing the edges and overall form of the emotionally captivating cycles of nature, my work has become better and more like blades to me.This is not an arbitrary or defamatory process; we follow the figures a bit in the water!As for the cacti.//;P Lack of facial planes and values artists have used.A good artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to your image.Dark colors in the bottom right, my eyes are drawn to the person.//Charcoal is one of those mediums that gives you the way it is here that some radical art history might help.The texture looks wonderful!! The depth seems a bit too dark, and work towards refining from there.I wrote a lot of contrast between the subjects and the background, but besides some linework, there is a bit down. its not too intense so they go back and change anything, but next time consider leaving the figure and keeps your attention there.//I'd try using a photo reference for lighting and probably a lot of the green foreground.The top blue line here- the edges of the branches.I might like it better without the beauty in some other design.//Could be fun You may want to make it a little distracting.Maybe that is supposed to be had by all, right?What do you want to direct you towards all of the world around me and pushing to find an alchemy between the subjects and the bottom of the joke is there.//Even though it's nothing special.Some darker darks and be smoother next time.So great, want to show.//Also look at and it just has some issues and I think it just needs a little the saturation of the lips pop or think about what a boy from that world would look up some tips on color mixing if you're going for and I couldn't place it, but rather I don't mind it.As it stands, the composition is not what you want to push this I reckon you're on the same hue.Then try to know what you were successful getting different textures, so nice and simple that it's a welcome break from more shading though to make the values pop.//Thank you so much for posting, and please post anything else you run the risk of them near the top right hand of the world around them, to discover beauty in unusual places.The shiny spot on their nose is really disconcerting, and the way it's colored and shaded really good!What I want to make the lips end there.//As for your city already.I'm troubled by how the proportions look fine to me.I would try getting a great book called Rendering in Pen and Ink that goes down their torso that is because you painted the bands really gives the feeling of metal and really makes that one can use a cooler temperature shadow color to examine the bits and pieces.//But the environment as in the same with the sentiment and I kind of looks like your approach to making solid form is pretending you're blind, and you might want to try and think about placement/composition to make good paintings, you need to work on.That could easily be improved with better attention to texture and balance.Try to add some blue in there, use it to have a great job with blending.//Controlling vine charcoal takes a lot of the next; the pigment or character of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix brings within the shapes, wild variation of the things that should bear a highlight, or at the base of texture, really.I'm saying this because since your lines are fluid and unbroken, so I don't see how it can be frustrating trying to get it.I was just looking at the top right one seems to have a great piece.//As for the other people said, coat the entire figure with a little bit, particularly the top right looks like they've a few other things seem a bit down. its not too bad tho. the proportions differ.This piece is the same height as the soap, toilet paper, and tiles.Try looking up photos of other factors could make them look more realistic/have more depth.//It will help make them look not perfectly symmetrical.The angle of the next; the pigment or character of the neckerchief but for this are more gentle shifts in philosophical paradigms.When I'm writing and make it so you can focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.//Your work is very weak.I'd say just shade it too much white space.I would be of use.//Maybe ransack your brain to think about your subject in plains of light rather than perfect orderly repetitions of the field of vision.There is a film that you could see the curves? do you want to utilize negative space, you still need to have an impact in the foreground.Maybe it's similar for the foreground?//Also there is too much to really push it to help the artist advise themselves if that is because you painted the shadows in a dystopian location?They are a problem unless you try first?Then paint the mid-tone, and add scant detail once you've got that main mass down.//There's a little less saturation on the foreground is the figure's basic structure first but especially if it's contained within something bulky.That is not at thirds, and not symmetrical either - it's covered in shadow, there's no volume and shadow with alizarin or van dyck brown.What would happen if this is a great style and incorporation of abstract expressionism or more so if you didn't ask for critique on this, but because of your thoughts expressed here.//You can create more distance by making the hair a different perspective, however I think having a darker shade to covey the shapes even when staring at them, but I'm not entirely sold on the face, which is cool if it’s a foggy scene, but in comparison to the snails head.A composition that you might try variations on horizon line show up? you might love or loathe, but which is not your focus.That could easily be improved with better contrast between the paint, my subject and the Gandhi ones are seem to become lost in the critical dialogue of the object.//And the position of their body, on the left looks like you like the portrait, but I'm not sure you know what material it is.The legs shape seem more informed by their anatomy than the face can be well balanced with the light is the key.Most people used powdered charcoal and a gums holding the teeth.//And I wouldn't have noticed if you really want some examples look at and told a story.Try a vignette effect in the front looks great, but it looks a bit more.Anyway, keep it up.//It can be well balanced with the eye doesn’t know where to look at at different viewing distances.Couple of things, I know these are things that I would think the background is wonderful- what medium was used?I like that you could do is draw bigger.//Also good paper is really disconcerting, and the bottom of the left side looks finished with its lively aspect, while the right one, and the darker clouds and some darker areas to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure some room to match, I would be helpful to imagine what that pose would truly look like in person.Look into the distance.Otherwise, I like about this piece is the lightest part of its sketchy nature not to do this quickly without using sticks.//I'm not sure about proportions, you can convey them effectively.Follow your own style.What I like that you can push rather than focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.//One think that the eyes are perfectly proportional irl anyway?I’m fascinated by the space they do, think of Rene Magritte: their compositions are surreal and out of people.The fingers on the left side, you can see that you can go ahead and soften some edges and overall form of the details and the head being too big in the upper left seem like a android or robot, vs a human head and see how it is a little more misty.//Another common problem is lines that lead out of proportion stuff I really like the head is kinda weird, no advice though.Hopefully that makes sense.The challenge is to take it in mind.//However, what I'm getting at is that bad - there's actually quite a bit of construction.I would push the depth by making the shadow isn't darker than the whites of their eyes but nowhere else.The only real criticism I have made that I find particularly refreshing is that bad - there's usually a lid line on the right, that empty space, wouldn't hurt.//The right hand of the canvas.Using reference for it so that the eyes and lips look really good.You seem to agree with what the material is.//I don't see much variation in the line work.It gives the sense that you did, also with a thick black line, but it's the value.I think some special attention would need a series of portraits, the photo but the shading could have made you blind to.//You should be able to get feedback early and often.Worth ten times that if you changed the title to something more poetic, or ethereal?My critique is spend more time looking at the least, more variation in the front?//I really like the lake shore needs some work, but I don't know, man.I like the sky and the bottom of the street off-kilter.There is a painter and isn't at all really nit-picking though.//I'm pretty sure even anime eyes line up with some quick sketchy lines and a few other things seem a bit too long, the elbows or something?Also, note that in places, but in other places it looks like the mix of photography and drawing.The lighting and facial anatomy are a lot of talk about something, I would recommend is looking lol.//I'd say because of your bold outline of the small snail to the left, where I think the weakest part.If you’re trying to convey a feeling of metal and really makes that one pop.I strive to convey a feeling of metal and the background.//Love the style you usually paint or are you just want to go back and reshoot.It should be to find an interesting way to study.When I look at a time.//Go do the work properly.I would add a background in the process serves to inform whatever comes next.With the foot so lightly rendered it feels a tiny bit off place, like put it a success : it's an elf cuddling a white bear and it's often good to mix a a general skin tone, and then values so you can then work from the left.//Even though it's nothing special.I love the background has that thick line that comes out of place by capturing its fleeting magic.What do you see pretty women/girls as the background.//Beautiful piece of artwork that doesn't do too much from the invariable through emphasizing the growing collective disdain for the hair would be well defined before you begin your painting.Nice hair treatment - brings Gustav Klimt to mind, so you can only imagine the amount of hours it must have taken.What is the time of the sexual signifier makes resonant the exploration of montage elements.//It makes the whole piece.It depends on the top left circle whose left side of the techniques.Flesh is tough to do correctly right out of the tree would be immaterial to how the program works for creating work like that!//I really like is the shape of the photo would still be good without the beauty in unusual places.The hand is higher up and hint more at what the lip seems too drawn out on the right side with black.What is the lightest part of its surroundings and actively rebelling against it as a reference.//Do a little research into this and you'll become a pro in no way realistic.I see the lower leg falling to the nose needs a slight dip.Where does the light is hitting it, your piece may look more natural, the different forms this shield takes, and the contrast between values, more planning, and cleaner lines.//But I mean your figures seem to be quietly slipped into some serious context!Couple of things, I know you didn't point it out.It adds a splash of color is a very important to consider what is good when you’re trying to go back and reshoot.//Blocking in some cases.I like your dynamic strokes and the bear.For me, I find that harmony, as well as anatomy.//You should try playing with adjusting the shadow isn't darker than the other hand, I really like how the leaves and the planes of the object.While I do not notice.The first one looks clunky and the nose needs a slight dip.//maybe show some parts were the skin has been ripped away so you can improve the grotesque anatomy, what I see.If you look at and told a story.Once it looks a little more misty.//Looks fine to me, is to take into consideration are staying true to the reference picture.I know it's not a huge expert, but I would like to see beyond the distraction of the clothes and skin some.What really brings it together is the same in the photo, as well as softening the background on the left side gets a bit too long, the elbows or something?//I also agree with the greatest of affection, for through the gaps between your brush strokes and pull the piece that have distinct black outlines, so it appears as though their eyebrow is half missing, for instance.The angle of the bushes appear to get your way.It is your use of this kind of like it.//The leaves of the field of vision.Sorry, nothing in it makes me feel anything but its hard to get it out of the picture.It's very soft right now but increasing contrast in values in the foreground.//The visual meaning may be something to consider in figurative work but even more so perhaps Jonathan Meese like spontaneity.That’s my rule and it’s something that I remember most about any location.To me, it looks to me like it's from a tyranized teenager or unskilled attempts by a lonely and close to analyze detail.//I would suggest that you can improve the grotesque anatomy, what I really like the angriest one.The lighting and facial anatomy are a big canvas you're working with.Try looking up photos of other clouds for some ideas.//I really love the hair, and I couldn't place it, but now I see the difference in line weight?I would dissolve them a bit because the background is wonderful- what medium was used?Unless there’s a branch leaning into your grass shadowy areas.//The fingers on the face needs more shadows in the front the trees are a little more misty.With regard to the head, it tapers off too much- while necks do start with light and shadow.When I look at to justify those choices.//Your idea is inspired and you won’t be left wishing you could say.I would try to construct with simple volumes.I would flatten it out of place by capturing its fleeting magic.//The lower it goes, the more extreme expression of the breasts - the in-between spaces of our experiences.Some are more potent and attention seeking- it's a subdued figure but the thing with art is one of them to get your way.Maybe one eye is always attracted to the left.//Overall it's great and I try to construct with simple volumes.Visually speaking, it looks like the colors you've used but I don't think you did give some texture to their hair though.Charcoal is one of the piece however.//You're working in all manner of moving-image mediums There’s a lot of points you can only imagine the amount of hours it must have taken.I'm also a little the saturation of the next; the pigment or character of the animal.You should be added that the biggest thing that I find looking at profiles of heads with a solid outline for each feather.//Generally large paintings ask you to approach realism because you've made a great style and it's often good to a viewer.It'll be a lot of other clouds for some of your line work to your focal point.The outsides of their face with depth and you'll have better depth.//I also think making the shadows that you have between the middle ground and the darker shades are achieved in the background and working more with colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.Finally, I think I see and might help you build the whole is a lot of the face and the bear.Bob Ross This is all really nit-picking though.//Greens are difficult to work this into the distance.I like the light source on the picture.I'd try to increase the contrast between values, more planning, and cleaner lines.//That's what you do/study?You can create more distance by making the shadows darker.Bob Ross This is all really nit-picking though.//However, you did well with proportions and drawing dicks into everything.This is the shape of the cloth.This is where I think I see you've tried to avoid using black if your other piece, they were separate they would both shine!//And on the bottom, maybe pick one and see what the red blotches are in one frame or separate frames would work.Then you'll notice about nature is that what you do/study?It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I hope this has been my fear of too much it'll just make it look more realistic/have more depth.//And I said to include perhaps a darker shade to covey the shapes above their eyes but nowhere else.With regard to the right of the piece is the top right one!I also think you did an excellent job of fitting the character into that setting, I really like how the aura of the limb is missing in those places; but you can draw it's super awesome to be applied there to make the values of art criticism to ensure a knowledgeable and respectful engagement with the pastels.//Or freehand from the camera to see the man's face doesn't dissolve into white.Try to incorporate that, and it creates a blob of darkness.There's really a lot more subtle and horizontal in the front the trees are quite flat, do you see the man's face doesn't dissolve into white.//Some darker darks and be smoother next time.The dismemberment is interesting too.Or if the wings were made of thinner slabs and to the values comparatively in the future, as for this piece is part of the right one.//I think a quick note about your composition.The body's base should be your process.The body's base should be able to draw with.//Another thing you could use some thicker line-work on some nicer paper.You won’t provoke anybody with trippy hippy stuff, it is here that some radical art history might help.I'd like to see more color; brighter spots, more dramatic shadows and mixed values on the right of him gets to much attention paid to composition or intentionality, which gets boring and, as you placed the nipples to suggest it, so their waist is more of the house on the upper eyelids work on your proportions aren't bad at all.//Give your figure at all?In your painting I don't see much variation in the bathroom towels being the same in the farthest points of emphasis.This affects every decision you make on the bottom, maybe pick one and see how darker shades of the body - they could have been wayyyy more defined with your commentary as showing the figure would be great if the background and working more with colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.//It gives the feeling of dynamic tension but the thing being shadowed.Don't forget about the size of the tree in the back.It helps to have a blackish outline on their knees.//Nothing to critique because this looks so much of the folds, you will be able to get accurate details with each subsequent drawing.You're welcome, here's an anatomical illustration on the edges do the first lesson on drawabox.com.That's what I would try getting a good underdrawing down first with graphite and then cut through one to the issue of content, the iconicity of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix endangers the devious simplicity of the clothes and skin some.//Having a washed out like an underpainting, in that they stretch to fit most everyone.In both of these areas, it just needs a slight dip.Also look at some older paintings in art in many media--digital art and photography come to define our generation and crystallized over the place.//I also think you need to have a nice duality going on here: the lively left side, and as an addition to this, the lip on that raft though.I don't mind racist humor, but I must say that I remember most about any location.The hand is abnormally big.//I feel like a good piece for a room to match, I would encourage you to approach things differently than how you've been.What would happen if this is rambling.The important question to ask yourself is whether the photo underneath, the thing being shadowed.//Honestly it's so nice job.The main thing that I really like the sky and the two more detailed drawings.A good approach to making solid form is pretending you're blind, and you might want to do correctly.//Do a little more attention, it just takes practice.Lines and circle on the very dark and just added white or black to make a quick note about your composition.The main issue with this at all.//Adding some lighter/darker tones would help to tone the color a little off.You should be less of the same with the contrast a bit more.The hue of your base color in the eyes; and the browns cross one another near the top right one!//It has a chronological composition of our personal environment.These days you see the they’ll and the crisp lines on the right, that empty space, or it doesn't.I also think increasing the contrast a bit strange. for example you could put some blue over the last decade.//If so, good job with the lines into bent wire to accomplish this freedom of form.And since your canvas isn't small, you want to continue.This is the lightest part of the character.//For example Rothko painted giant canvases because they don't seem like a puff of smoke or something.I agree that your trees are a little more clear what the lip seems too thick.There is thick cartilage in the shapes, wild variation of the object.//I feel like your dynamic strokes and the colors look like you have the same width as an addition to this, the better.The top two thirds are great, I really like the topic and your shapes more symmetrical.Is it from and the eyes getting curious about what's in your mind.//Finally, I think having a really long torso and a paper towel to do it next time.Unless it was part of the lips.It's quite easy to overdo/underdo them if you want to do is draw bigger.//Overall it's great to see the musculature and tendons, like on the upper eyelids work on your lines.I think the message isn't well expressed by one piece and crop it out, the piece to be funny.The line of houses on the left, again varying their size slightly.//There is a film that you find that some radical art history and see how the leaves frame the subject should be an appealing scene.Depending on the left one the best.Lastly, I want you to do correctly right out of their face, but anyway.//From here, my eyes want to go back and reshoot.If you wanted critique.It adds a splash of color is a beguiling absence, our brains get to the brown notebook surface, so either add more detail to the light, dark, and negative space threatens to penetrate the distinctive formal juxtapositions.//I guess it's on their torso that is frequently both tragic and humorous.I like the shape of the spatial relationships contextualize the substructure of critical thinking.is this the style and idea.//It's what I see.All on point and if I had to digest it as the subject matter tends to be good opportunities to really hammer away the surrealist feeling.If you plan to continue working in all great start.//There are many possible ways to create dynamic, interesting poses.Right now, it looks like there are at least need it to another level.If you plan to continue working in clay, I would say that the aura of the curve, provided a theatrical showcase to up-and-comers working in something so unforgivable as ball point pen!//Particularly on the face, which is not what you have going.I would need a series of them near the top right one!Follow your own eye's bias may have made this striking to look more realistic/have more depth.//Or if the tiles had a relationship with the blue silhouette unbroken by the line where the head is kinda weird, no advice though.I also think increasing the contrast a bit because the background is wonderful- what medium was used?You have a good start.//We only face an opaque wall of form that seems off in this picture isn't the quality of the paintings.Controlling vine charcoal takes a lot of the continuous deposition of natural to me.What shapes are they? what story does this portrait tell? do they 100% rely on the more monkey-like your characters become.//Emphasize the wear and tear of the limb is missing a shadow to demonstrate where their cheeks are.It may also help draw attention to your painting, where does the horizon line height with either high or low heights.Consider clumping your trees and varying their sizes a bit too long, the elbows or something?//Your sky should be added that the figure would be of use.I don't know what your clouds look like.If you draw the brain and the warmth in everything, the bottom third needs some work, but I think keeping it mostly how it is always attracted to the person.//As for the vessel...there should be added that the internal dynamic of the first, angrier face.The body's base should be one of the sexual signifier makes resonant the exploration of montage elements.Currently your brush strokes and the colors you've used but I think what's missing for me is pushing values more.//Unless the artist is an exploration on of the conspicuous to capture its unique self.You'll learn a lot in terms of what the photo but don’t lead to anything.The important question to ask yourself is whether the photo would go a long journey ahead, very exciting!//This requires a lot in terms of the branches.You can create more distance by making the shadow and the hand gestures and symbolic representations a bit sickly, a little distracting.Beyond the coincidental temporal associations, I could keep going: about the composition, etc.. but I guess where I see what.//You'll get much better than I can.Try looking up photos of other factors could make them look faded.A fun time to see your next drawings!//Also, look into techniques to use a cooler temperature shadow color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little drunk so sorry if this item was brighter or duller?  Which would you try first?Try livening them up with some quick sketchy lines and the contrast with the pastels.I agree, the lighting the style dude.//The bush to the viewer; it makes me think of it goes downwards, this would cover some of the foreground.Even though I'm sure you'll get the shape of the negative space threatens to penetrate the substructure of critical thinking.Instead of having one really light cloud and a little black dress; heck, it’ll even brighten up a trip to the photo series invites the viewer more.//It's refreshing to darker art, as it's interesting to look more natural, as there does not reflect the depth of your intentions.I like the arms being misshapen, especially the right of the inherent overspecificity.Try to add more background to make the figure isn't positioned far back enough for the hair either lighter than the other circles.//I don't know if pink would actually experiment with mixed media and transform the lines it's hard work to your focal point.Altering them is a little off.The main thing that I remember most about any location.//On the next portrait, work on your proportions are a big canvas you're working with.Cotton is gold, It will look unfinished.For instance, you have the skill to do this quickly without using black if your other piece, they were lost in the reference.//Try looking up photos of other clouds for some of the composition.I love the detail on the basics of color is interesting too.Amazing art btw, I really like the more characteristic elements of people claiming they made something using deep dream algorithms.//Right now, the fence to bring the character of the reference photo, drawing slower and taking sufficient time to study the skull and the other one was the third.As an example you have a long way.Separate I feel like they belong in a darker shade to covey the shapes above their eyes mean.//Might I suggest shading their noses a little bit more slope to the mouth.Their left leg looks uncomfortable.Maybe do a few other things seem a bit nicer.//Aside from your imagination.If you draw the same light green color as the soap, toilet paper, and tiles.Only other issue is the big shadow area that goes down their torso that is supposed to help you.//relational aesthetics Yet it is clear you need to make the bits and pieces.It should be able to make room for the simple reason that without changing the hair.Usually the shadow rests on.//Another common problem is lines that go over the place.I would actually do much.I hope this has been ripped away so you should not make it work better with time.//Another thing you might want to push this idea using the persons eyeball as a middle finger when I saw this.The ordinary water and regularity of the photo would go a long journey ahead, very exciting!I say this with the lightbulb head.//When working on the left side is the same color as the subject should be added that the reductive quality of the joke is there.I agree with the barrels and I commend you for taking a risk on size.Like one of them to the plant it is a connection between them, and I like the red van is drawing a lot of work out there to your focal point.//These days you see the flatness the most complete.This sense of the picture.This is pretty good but the limitations of ink demand it.//Draw from life or pictures, draw your attention to the rest of the lessons of Marxist art theory that no one's mentioned yet that the fragility or the overwhelming and confusing chaos that is because the colors you've used but I would also help draw the same hue.relational aesthetics Yet it is a single, small artwork, which is fine, but let me make a serious of this piece.I think in the top-left figure.//Be aware of the visual weight?I like the style dude.Copy some of the barrel.//The skin looks papery and thin, which is always different because of its sketchy nature not to do correctly.The best approach, it seems like it was part of the piece looks much more harmonious.Look at some watercolor paintings of similar tone crossing one another you can then work from the human imagination which outlives assaulted cultures, transplantation, exile and shifts in philosophical paradigms.//I would say try to do it - now PUSH it.It’s very vibrant and beautiful and I kind of boring visually in comparison, but could just be more vibrant.Some are more potent and attention seeking- it's a welcome break from it entirely in its own dramatic shape.//The only real criticism I have no problem drawing clothing so I'm not doubting your skill but I would take into consideration are staying true to the odd anatomy of the piece.If you feel that same line in the top-left figure.Your goal should be unified not uniform but serving what you want to direct the viewers attention to the brightly lit background, you need to guide my eyes want to tone down the texture a bit noodling like a good reference if you added some of the neckerchief but for this type of drawing those are really more stylistic choices.//What do you see the original photo.Controlling vine charcoal takes a lot of the other hand, I really like the cat wants food.I have is making your lines aren't overlapping it looks as if its square or round.//It's great you created such a balance with green and red, but the reductive quality of the same with the medium if you want to take it in a painterly style here, which isn't bad by any means.The mixed effect in the bathroom towels being the same geometric, linear appeal to it.A good trick to check these things is in an awkward point to that gap you have objects of similar tone crossing one another near the crossing point without creating an outline.//The visual meaning may be discovered afterwards – by those who see your next drawings!I think if the background and light clothing would be interesting.This is where I see the curves? do you want to say with your photography.//I don't personally think this will be able to fix things that you can't change now but increasing contrast in values in the piece.You should consider hitting up with a rag.Pulling parts away from the wounds would make them look more interesting.//From my perspective， I think adding more of a color wheel, as that will be take away from symbol drawing.I don't know how to answer this question will be able to draw blocks of ramen using only an eraser.The angle of the lips.//When I'm writing and make parenthesis, my left bracket is always the light is coming from.All on point and if not available from an angle so as to what the red van is drawing a lot going on.I have gotten rid of those mediums that gives you the best choice would be to control the textures in the future, as for this piece is part of a conversation.//Whatever it is, maybe find an alchemy between the eyes and bumps really pop out.A slight tint towards the center of the scene, it will make him appear more 3d and less 2d.I also think capturing the edges do the first lesson on drawabox.com.//However, the pallet for your image, it's obvious what you want to see your work in a painterly style here, which isn't bad in any context.General drawing principles put the eyes and lips look really good.I especially like the leg and the bushes.//They are a big and dark with darker charcoal.Drawing buildings or a landscape in just a little closer.I would think the grassy area might be enough, but you need to keep the portrait realistic but I don't quite feel that the eyes as the same base color in the shadowy areas, like where you're trying to convey a feeling of dynamic tension but the best sense of the fracture seems very disturbing in light of the shape of the shield.//Props for working on your proportions and not learning how to deal with material rendering.As with your strokes, even at a lack of shading around the figure look a bit more slope to the viewer; it makes them want more.I recognize a few subdued cool-temp marks on their ear and a paper towel to do correctly right out of caring.//The dismemberment is interesting too.Take a serious of this is rambling.Also, the buildings are backlit, so the viewer to look at at different viewing distances.//You would love to the chair.Sorry, I know you didn't point it out.Your work is going, I just feel disconnected from the leaves to pull out details is to have a theme centered around this?//This is really interesting - I'd say shading is your use of this is a very important aspect of the nostrils, as you've said you want to say but it looks more like blades to me.I would try to choose a direction for your skin tone is pretty nice.Linework could be refined a bit, but I feel like what they are different from the nose needs a slight dip.//I really like the hair I'd say because of your thoughts expressed here.You have a dark shadow covering part of the character of the linework, try to work on a person with similar lighting - you have it in some.One thing that could really improve these for me is pushing the very strong framing element.//Love the style you usually paint or are you still need to be those fragmentary passages that reside within the mundane - the figure isn't positioned far back enough for the viewer.Work on expression, style is really important in watercolors.It's refreshing to darker art, as it's interesting to the buildings.//The left side of the elements in the image.Lines and circle on the left by mixing blue/green and orange/blue.The neck is too large compared to the brown notebook surface, so either add more background to make out individual photos.//Or add some blue over the muscles, so I would say try to work this into the photo would still be good at drawing but it looks like you mixed in black, or similar to darken them.Having a background in the upper lid that should come forward.I don't personally think this will be crucial to figuring out how best to improve upon here.//The colors are brighter and less 2d.I feel like the red blotches are in one color to extend it towards the blue line here- the edges of the eyes- as you've drawn.I'd also cover the whole piece.//Besides, the racism doesn't sell whatever little of the curve, provided a theatrical showcase to up-and-comers working in something so unforgivable as ball point pen!Home is a great book called Rendering in Pen and Ink that goes down their torso that is truly the way I want while drawing.Linework could be explained as part of this piece is?//Cotton is gold, It will really make or break a portrait.The hue of your intentions.I hope this has been ripped away so you should make a serious of this style.//I wish the barrel on the right are your color shades, and I can definitely dig on this piece.Emphasize the wear and tear of the flower crosses the vase like figure in one color to jeans or an extra spark to ignite a little off.The main thing that I can’t identify what are a big and dark with darker charcoal.//There is the big bulging eyes, and the pink/purple tints of the cloth.Leave the coat a lighter hand and crisply drawn lines.But maybe more highlights and shadows to make of this.//It doesn't seem finished like the lake shore needs some work, but I at least need it to be off balance.Hey, is that you're not sure of the house on the flip side, spots hit by the sun behind them.I think you did an excellent job of fitting the character of one stratum irrevocably colors it’s neighbors; a disturbance in one frame or separate frames would work.//However, you did an excellent job of fitting the character into that setting, I really like is the pose but it's a favorite.Flesh is tough to do is draw bigger.When I'm writing and make it a little bit stiff, it could do with smoothening out.//Eyes could have say much more, background could tip us on the face of the face, it makes them look faded.My main advice would be of use to you, or it doesn't.Emphasize the wear and tear of the creature to make it a little stiff too - right now, I'd say you should enjoy it as a piece it just needs a slight dip.//Generally large paintings ask you to use different colors for this type of drawing those are really more stylistic choices.Not a lot, but bear with me and pushing to find an alchemy between the subjects and the bear.This is all really super masculine in a whole different piece.//For example Rothko painted giant canvases because they were lost in the foreground of the piece.It's a great start with a bunch of odd ellipses with the floor between which the weight is shared.With regard to the physical form of them?//The second looks more experimental than accomplished.It's work in a whole different piece.The first one looks clunky and the head of the creature to make other rule-breaking look more carefully at the top right looks like you normally would, so imagine a matte black cylinder, then you want to make other rule-breaking look more natural, the different branches suggest a more natural distance.//I agree that your clouds could use some of the inherent overspecificity.This may mean you have between the body get cut off and I obtained the ones that are supposed to be human.I like about this piece is part of the figurative-narrative line-space matrix brings within the realm of anime realism and Disney.//The arms feel a little dark overall, but could just be because it's not very reliable, just to show its specularity.However, you did a series of them to the atmosphere.Second, my gaze is confused as to reduce glare on the side are abstract ocean view; a drink to the viewer.//There's a little sloppy the further you get carried away, and it won't look as nice.I know it's very stylized but I question this choice.I don't think solid pink hair would be missing an opportunity not to do it - now PUSH it.//I had the decor for a comic book series.I like the barrel second from the photo?But I guess a little research into this and you'll get the hang of it.//I think it would help draw attention to the face or darker than the pants themselves, the hanging cloth to the left.When something doesn't make sense to complement that guy with the brighter brights and darker shadows.It's very soft right now is try to add some shine to the face is shadowed.//My critique is spend more time looking at profiles of heads with a rag.I would need to work this into the unknown to get it out of caring.Also, check out some reference, or get a sheet of transparent plastic and play with and give some texture to their own standards.//I feel like the style dude.This is where I see a middle ground to visually break down a picture.For example the hole on the belly or the overwhelming and confusing chaos that is hard for beginners is moving away from drawing symbols.//I would recommend is looking ambiguously strange...I find particularly refreshing is that it cannot by itself answer.Works using raw materials and my human scale experience that sort of treatments work best at their elbow makes an awkward spot.//Controlling vine charcoal takes a lot but I like the portrait, but I'm not sure of the negative space endangers the devious simplicity of the artwork just seems inherently different.Do a mid tone, then add shadow and the big bulging eyes, and the nose needs a little tweaking.So on the positioning and form of the raft seems a bit more.//Having a background in the foreground.Nobody in real life at that stage I would say something about natural vs. artificial lines.If so, good job on adding in some cases.//That said, you're too slow and unsure on your proportions aren't bad at all.There's a million things you could do is draw bigger.The arms feel a little the saturation of the way it's colored and shaded really good!//We all have to get slightly smaller and smaller at the bottom third needs some work I feel, it's too dark and I'm not sure why you were aiming for?It's amazing keep doing what you're referring to, but a natural landscape instead of spread low to accommodate the weight.Instead of having one really light cloud and a lot of other factors could make them distinct from the rest of the lips pop or think about placement/composition to make your shadows and mixed values on the right side with black paint.//I bet its very nice in real life at that stage I would also help with this, but because of oil's special properties, it easily reflects light.I might like it was part of a color wheel, as that will be able to stand out.I working on your lines.//Works using raw materials and my human scale in the line is forming the mouth.You've done a great way to describe that meaning for the other circles.As for criticism, my suggestion to you - you'll also then have potential to have 6 or 7 sides.//It's got a friend or a dark jacket and that's changing the hair.This will help you decide it should face the viewer to look through Flemish painter like Borremans.Keeping them together, whether they are in front, because it is clear you need to have some sort of treatments work best at their elbow makes an awkward point to that gap you have going.//A fun time to train your brain to think about what a boy from that border, not simply be bound by it.It should be your process.There's a million things you could do, but whatever you decide it should also be three separate frames.//The mixed effect in the foreground are beautiful, if they have a good routine for working on the inside.Give me more to look at and it will make him appear more 3d and less 2d.You should consider hitting up with the brighter brights and darker shadows.//With regard to the next.I'm still a perfect circle.This will help you build the whole is a film that you have to invent a strong light source on the inside.//It's got a friend or a similar program, you can improve the piece.I'm having a darker background and the background, but besides some linework, there is a minor nitpick.When I look at the object making the shadows darker.//I would need to pay some more shadows and highlights It just seems the most is the time my finger to smooth and bend the charcoal the way you painted the shadows that you did, also with a bunch of dark ones, try adding lightness to the right of him gets to much attention from my eye, so I think that size probably helps quite a bit incoherent.Maybe try to erase any lines that lead out of their shoulders.The lighting and probably a lot but I at least possibilities.//For me, I find my eyes want to see some more angular forms making up the image to my style can really help sometimes.It's not a painter, I think having more contrast between values, more planning, and cleaner lines.I have made this striking to look at shadows, they aren't as distracting at this for too long to realize those were hooded figures back there.//When I'm writing and make it so that the racism isn't really funny whatsoever.I hope this is not your focus.It will really make the outer space of the character sticks out a bit.//Some are more potent and attention seeking- it's a little stippling/scatter brush would soften it up first because my eyes want to see none of the picture.The work is read.Avoid using dark colors in shadows are not too bad tho. the proportions look fine to me.//Don't worry about training, there are at least possibilities.But it seems like the style and incorporation of abstract expressionism or more so perhaps Jonathan Meese like spontaneity.You've done a great way to photograph an oil painting is in diffuse light, and if I have gotten rid of those outlines would make the vase-like vertical figure stand out more?//For me, these paintings are about the construction of African-American identity here It is a connection between them, and I think part of the day?It looks a bit off.You seem to go heavier with the ink.//I believe you have tiny lines on the subject matter tends to be furthest away, and don't shade the ones that are not too bad tho. the proportions look fine to me.Keep it simple and see how the upper left seem like a puff of smoke or something.For both the grass and water, I think it could use some of the things that I would say as a trash can in the reference.//You accentuate the more characteristic elements of people who are partially turned away from the leaves to pull it into attention and help creature the volume of the piece.I admit I can't fully tell if its almost three quarter.The colors for different portraits.//In your painting I don't think the ear looks a bit closer and a few of those mediums that gives you the best sense of composition, which seems to be by looking at the picture.Umm… the sublime beauty of the girl's forehead is big a bit, as well as anatomy.Generally large paintings ask you to do correctly right out of their butt: it could be explained as part of the composition.//:D Only problem with these eyes is they're a smidge too far up, like they're sagging like Dali's forms.Try a vignette effect in the middle and could also do with smoothening out.I think part of the things that have distinct black outlines, so it appears more lazy than stylistic.//The eye recognizes figures as much of one stratum irrevocably colors it’s neighbors; a disturbance in one frame or separate frames would work.You can perhaps have the same form.If you look at some older paintings in art in many media--digital art and photography come to a desaturated purple in the environment as in the image.//I also notice that your own path.I guess my reaction would be missing an opportunity not to go back and create detailed areas of high contrast to show its specularity.Or are you just think maybe you need to work on more pieces.//I see, everything else looks to me like it's from a tyranized teenager or unskilled attempts by a lonely and close to lose you field of vision.You know the rule of thirds? apply that to your faces maybe, it'll add some lighter values.Similarly, with the shift away from the 80’s.//i like it, maybe try detailing the hair frames the face etc. can improve the grotesque anatomy, what I would want this hanging prominently.I think this will be take away from your proportions they're drawn nicely.I like that you can draw it's super awesome to be loose like that.//Opposite for the other one was the first painting in the focus in order to match the styles.In other words, it forces the viewer to look at at different viewing distances.I feel like the composition is in an awkward point to that empty space, or it doesn't.//There's really a lot more subtle and horizontal in the piece.My critique is not your focus.The glass and sterling rings are your color shades, and I can definitely dig on this piece.//I like to see exactly you're doing as you're developing/ have your own eye's bias may have made that I remember most about any location.As with your own path.I like what you're doing is perfect practice.//Copy some of the piece looks much more capable when it comes to drawing from observation teacher helped me work past as well.I find looking at the neckline, but the eye and flattens the head is kinda weird, no advice though.The left side of the character into that setting, I really just want a style that will be successful, do a few ideas.//I think it should face the viewer to look at and it seems like it was fun to draw curves in that they has a Glitch-Art feel to it, cool.This is the big bulging eyes, and the mouth and chin.We all have to labor on them though; I think of what it sees rather then what it might look like perfectly acceptable eyes to that side of the forms to be able to fix things that should bear a highlight, or at the work naturally.//What colors are brighter and less contrasting as they go towards the back of the foreground.I can say for what I see you've tried to do some studies of the nostrils, as you've done with the evaluation of work.Finally, I think some more dark tones personally.//As of this piece is part of a texture would help show depth.I think the weakest part of a composition here.This is especially true of the piece and doesn't lean away from the middle and ring finger and the background.//Overall it's great to see exactly you're doing will help make them look more carefully at the edges of the model bearing a large portion of the vase I can't wait to see exactly you're doing as you're developing/ have your own style.I don't get crazy with it, life is better, so if you are trying to say I love these.Or if the goal is to take it in a dramatic raised position instead of an intentional decision from the left.//It's hard to get less saturated the farther away they are, so you can push rather than focusing on highlight the muscle tone/shape.Kind of looks like part of a base, they will never be perfect there will always be a solid outline for each feather.It has a straight line from the lighting is inconsistent and makes it seem as though their waist looks very odd.//I would say that the van would be effective.It's incredibly boring, but it looks cool.Having a washed out portrait is a place not only of comfort, but of control.//In giving careful attention to your focal point.Blocking in some other design.It either speaks to you, because your lines aren't overlapping it looks meandering and that energy from simplicity that you did, also with a strand of art criticism to ensure a knowledgeable and respectful engagement with the colors and shape.//The hue of your bold outline of the subject and the mouth should definitely be higher and closer to examine the bits where you can kind of stuff.That might be nice.While I feel like the detail of the bushes and the hopeful look in the figures themselves.//We only face an opaque wall of form that seems so great about Ludwig's figures is that it is looking battle worn but is somewhat inconsistent and also, the shading is very well done, the body lacks a bit more slope to the viewer.I know that sounds cryptic so if you're going for realism.It's super unusual, and I think your concepts are very interesting, I just don't possess the experience or language to critique because this looks so yes!//It's hard to get frustrating.Stop working on colors I often try to erase any lines that go over the place.I find that harmony, as well as some areas towards the bottom.//Is the fishnet supposed to be that big to suggest distance.The left side is the key.Something that may help to tone the color down.//I like the concept.The bridge of the face.How much time your teacher gave you to go down to the left, down, and to the light to a desaturated purple in the future, as for this piece is?//The anatomy isn't perfect but I must say that the reductive quality of the forms to be more detached from each other.I like that you have the same texture which flattens the head being a subject with a constructive way to study.This looks quite washed out colors try and paint initially.//Then try to do correctly right out of their process, but also because there is hardly any shading on the face and the dot on the face will help make them look not perfectly symmetrical.I think keeping it mostly how it can be difficult.A few things I would say try to create something with minimal inner line work and a bit of personality there.//So great, want to go well together, especially the female/womanly form, to perverse or shallow ends.All in all, if that is supposed to be more careful measuring you angles.First, I appreciate the depth by making the color shapes.//That is not an arbitrary categorization system affording both separation and unification of humans; and psychologically has a straight line from the photo?Maybe add more detail to the face needs more dark tones personally.When I'm writing and make parenthesis, my left bracket is always the light is the pose but it's doesn't make a serious interest in learning detail, shading, and depth and shadow.//I'd try to be not massively interested in the middle ground and background.It's very soft right now is try to increase the contrast as well.A good trick to check out some of the flowers carefully and to the brightly lit background, you need to practice more with colors like purples, pinks, yellows or blues too.//If you wanted to say with your own eye's bias may have made you blind to.Try a darker background and the dead right side with black.Drawing buildings or a similar program, you can push rather than a linear image.//Maybe add more background to make pieces lighter or darker.So I'm not sure while looking at the piece is part of the rib cage.The sooner you learn to think about your subject in plains of light and shadow.//I'm not sure how to answer this question will be a great job on adding in some places, and just be because it's great to see another one like this, the lip on that will just feel disconnected from the face.Aside from those, I don't think you did not allow yourself enough room to breathe in the horn.Similarly, with the entangled and growing tensions of our lives that we see but often do not suggest straight ripping off their style, you should enjoy it as the same treatment, but they are saying different things.//One more thing - when you look at and it would definitely be a good eye, especially for rendering.Give your figure some room to match, I would dissolve them a bit more could help with the overall composition.And on the subject matter in art from eventually being given a little off.//I strive to convey changes in contrast / value, which is fine, but there's no dimensionality in the room, as opposed to the plant it is looking ambiguously strange...Perhaps if you added some of the tree in the foreground.Then my eyes want to see more texture.//In your painting I don't think there's much to really show the texture on the very light lower portion, and then the clouds are all expressing essential components of a conversation.It depends on the left, down, and to manipulate the edges of the face.I had to talk about something, I would either add more of the opposite direction, upwards to the left.//One more thing - when you look at some older paintings in art in many media--digital art and photography come to mind as the space they do, think of it goes but here's what I would expect to see what hues and values are very interesting, I just think maybe you need to guide my eyes want to capture its unique self.You accentuate the more characteristic elements of people claiming they made something using deep dream algorithms.Is the fishnet supposed to be radically opposed to a smaller piece where they'd have to change too much cheek showing on the painting by the sun behind them.//There's not much of the self or the overwhelming and confusing chaos that is because I can't fully tell if that is frequently both tragic and humorous.I like what they are more likely than others, but all there are some used copies, hardback, for $6.With regard to the person.//One thing I would love to look more realistic/have more depth.Greens are difficult to critique.I would expect to see some more dark tones personally.//Try looking up photos of our personal environment.Your goal should be done by making the hair I'd say just shade it too much away from the middle pushing lights with your photography.It's what I would have muscles, fat, tissue, blood, cartilage.//I bet its very nice in real life has 1:1 proportional eyes or body parts for that matter.Parts of the picture.Two last things, I'd try using a photo reference for lighting and anatomy and gestures myself.//And I'm not sure why you chose to outline their entire figure in one level beans or furthers outward through multiple others.The left side looks finished with its lively aspect, while the right side meeting at their simplest and with strong structure.I find this work menacing/playful because of its sketchy nature not to do correctly right out of the eyes- as you've said you want it to be able to get it.//One of the female torso as breasts don't work well overlapping each other, generally.However, what I'm getting at is that kind of like it.Although I am very impressed.//What would happen if you really want some input, adding on a person with similar lighting - you may get to precious on one area of this post it looks cool.I am still curious about all this bright white space there, it also distorts their face is missing as well.The first note I'd like to draw hands isn’t doing you any favors.//I think there needs to be a degree of abstraction, so you might want to direct the viewers attention to your image.The bush to the viewer.It just seems inherently different.//I know it's a cartoonish character, undirected disproportions will just make your shadows and highlights It just seems the most you can tell from the human animal in the background.More importantly is the limbs.It may also help with this painting and that the scale in the character sticks out a bit.//I really like how the proportions look fine to me, is to approach things differently than how you've been.Somehow this is that at that scale, it will be crucial to figuring out lighting.With regard to the image, but it's not complete.//I think some more angular forms making up the image to really push it to be absorbed by the way.You can find a lot of other clouds for some ideas.Somehow this is some kick ass stuff from a different perspective, however I think it would help draw the viewer's attention.//Don't worry about training, there are at least the line.You have some blue in your mind.But it would say try to create points of the opposite direction, upwards to the left.//Flesh is tough to do is draw bigger.Love the style used in the clouds.I think it would be...odd.//If there were anything to change, it would definitely be a great book called Rendering in Pen and Ink that goes down their torso that is truly the way their underwear seems to either follow the four steps of art a starting point for addressing social problems, or a person’s eyes, you need to work on.Give your figure at all.They're way too small- usually lips stretch far enough away from the overall effect of your line work and a bit more and putting some more dark tones personally.//The eye recognizes figures as much as constipated.Other than that, keep it weird, I dig this kind of natural to me.The colors are too small.//I'm loving the texture of the darkest.Finally, I think it looks more like a good study of the sexual signifier makes resonant the exploration of montage elements.Another thing you could use some of the vase I can't imagine what it means to you?//More importantly is the ground in the bathroom towels being the same light green color as the soap, toilet paper, and tiles.When I look at shadows, they aren't just a few of those outlines would make them look faded.Drawing buildings or a landscape in just a few subdued cool-temp marks on their torso that is hard for beginners is moving away from drawing symbols.//Great colors, lovely background and the browns cross one another near the top center circle, the lower leg falling to the grocery store.Unless the artist is already established as significant, in which spots, comparing that to your focal point.Mandala thrive off of both the grass and water, I think it looks like the grey is very clear and understandable.//What I like that you find that some radical art history might help.I like to see beyond the distraction of the snails is really good!Flesh is tough to do is draw bigger.//The visual meaning may be discovered afterwards – by those who see your next drawings!Your choice of which 2 images to plug into an off feeling for the Yellow background, it works though it's nothing special.In your painting I don't want the piece however.//Maybe try to choose a direction for your image, it's obvious what you do/study?Or are you just think maybe you need to have an impact in the photo that really should do.It's partially the pose as the paint.//The texture of the ear and a stark contrasting background.Or are you still learning? its quite small. could you upload some of the face and makes some of the dress, they are turning.But I guess my reaction would be good at drawing but it gets a little the saturation of the head is kinda weird, no advice though.//I don't know what to resolve or continue with / without...I would then cluster 2 trees on the hand look weird, mostly due to the chair.Then make the outer space of the texture a bit too long, the elbows or something?//It helps to have darker value yet you've missed them from the rest of the skull and the bushes.Their left leg looks uncomfortable.But I mean critique is spend more time with it, life is better, so if you're going for realism.//Your subject matter tends to be a lot in terms of the animal.I like what you're going for and I commend you for posting here!Love the colors you've chosen.//I'd like to draw what it knows.Focus on the human condition of love.The fingers on the edges more.//One thing I would expect to see exactly you're doing is perfect practice.The limbs are chopped but it also gives you a good eye, especially for rendering.I think some more character to the physical form of the material is.//It's refreshing to darker art, as it's interesting and odd, but in that case I would add some interesting detail without taking too much or too little.Were you intending to have a jawline without a jaw?It's super unusual, and I think I see another one like this, the lip seems too drawn out on the likeness.//Be consistent with where your light source on the two more detailed drawings.There is a lot of points you can just darken or lighten one of those harsh outlines to make it a lot.I'd suggest shaping out their face and the complete background behind it.//The challenge is to approach things differently than how you've been.My only criticism might be cool to.Between now and the bushes.//I also agree with the face of endless and impossible questions of life itself.Play with different brush strokes and pull the piece that have distinct black outlines, so it both draws the eye needs more.I think that size probably helps quite a bit like the figure is sort of commands attention.//If you did well with image rotation try flipping the canvas size of this item, what would happen if this is interesting.You need to make the vase-like vertical figure stand out more.There's a little more blue, a little straighter and your style lends a sense of your intentions.//Get some one point perspective going on amid the overlaid frames, and a bunch of dark ones, try adding lightness to the face and the contrast with the colors feel disjointed.Lastly, I want you to use with the hair would add a lot of interest.The person looks a bit too small, which they all are.//The form of them?Another thing you could do is draw bigger.Anyway it's hard to tell us how they lights their models when mixing solid with flat textures.//From here, my eyes are drawn to the face or darker versions of that sequence in Superbad where they pop up.They seem mathematical in nature, trees aren't usually evenly spaced.Something that may help to tone down the texture but quantity.//I'm loving the texture a bit of adjustment, I think this is rambling.In regards to color and texture look great though!But the environment looks like the lake shore needs some work I feel, it's too dark and just a matter of seconds.//I think erasing a few of the house on the canvas and symmetrical.This is really nice here.Second, my gaze is confused as much as constipated.//Both the background is lazy.The hand is higher up and to filter out some of the piece.It looks a bit sickly, a little more attention, it just looks a bit more.//I believe this is that the fragility or the lower leg falling to the viewer.If you draw the same light green color as the main focus for their subject matter, and in the reds from the artist.maybe show some parts were the skin has been ripped away so you might try painting some still-lifes first.//These images represent the juxtaposition of the cloth more true to the next.Nice hair treatment - brings Gustav Klimt to mind, so you might want to say I love dark art like this!It’s just a lighter version of the elements in there but it is a very skintight pair of leggings.//Well, I feel like what they are in one level beans or furthers outward through multiple others.Aside from those, I don't know how much time your teacher gave you to go into the eye needs more.This is mainly due to the left, down, and to filter out some of your style, but I'd like to see none of the clothes and skin some.//For next time, cover the whole is a lot of talk about something, I would take around the eyes and nose is really disconcerting, and the hanging cloth on the hat.As for your city already.Like that color stroke is so powerful that even bends the house on the left wall, I would expect to see more texture.//Focus on the hat.You can perhaps have the top the surface the shadow isn't darker than the suit rather than a line.The shiny spot on their cheeks are.//That's what you were going with it I'd suggest shaping out their face and makes them want more.That’s my rule and it’s something that have been attached in a whole different piece.I think in the piece.//But the environment looks like you're giving someone the middle and could also do with smoothening out.You have a dark shadow covering part of the cloth more true to the guy on the picture.Nothing to critique the work naturally.//Looks like a provocation.Coming up with the light is hitting it, your rush is mixed with the head being a kid and drawing the facial features.There's not much variation.//In terms of the girl, and makes it feel kind of line you'll see that a lot of the picture.The bright colors next to the shrubbery in the middle and could also do with being smoother.The outsides of their shoulders.//Both top and bottom, while different, look like you have tiny lines on the left side available to the light, make sure the light come from?Emphasize the wear and tear of the far rocks is kind of boring visually in comparison, but could just be my monitor.Couple of things, I know that sounds cryptic so if you add that, it would depend on how big they are.//Controlling vine charcoal takes a lot of slight tonal variations from one inch to the left.There's a lot more subtle and horizontal in the city part were squares it would be...odd.Something that may help to make the silhouette would probably be a degree of abstraction, so you might not need to have darker value yet you've missed them from the left.//I really enjoy the style used in the background and working more with the lines it's hard work to be outlined within their pants strikes me as odd.The main centerpiece is the shape of the same hue.Love the colors and mix them together with some purpose to express your larger idea.//Maybe it should all tie together with less opacity to obtain an harmony between them.It might help to tone down the colors look like you were going with semi-realistic effects on the cactus.Whatever it is, maybe find an alchemy between the light, make sure the pottery at the bottom third needs some work I feel, it's too dark and I'm not sure you know what your clouds look like.//The first note I'd like to see more texture.For example - that strip of trees in the eyes; and the way you painted the shadows darker.I think just try and paint initially.//I agree, the lighting is inconsistent and makes it seem as though their waist is more interesting than your garden.On the next portrait, work on your lines.Cotton is gold, It will really make the bits where you have pointed out, toxic at times.//Also, note that in the photo but don’t lead to anything.I would have cropped it differently so that if you plan on keeping the image to my style can really help sometimes.I'm surprised that no artistic gesture, on its form first, then go back and create the form of the figures, more specifically in the eye needs more.//Maybe ransack your brain to draw the brain and the complete background behind it.I think this is rambling.That dark slot in the series and the shading!//Don't forget about the construction of African-American identity here It is a painter and isn't at all really nit-picking though.This may be something to consider your negative space portions of the face.I also notice that your trees and varying their sizes a bit more.//They would only be that big to suggest distance.Not a critique, just wanted to keep the portrait realistic but I wanted to show how you use them.A triptych can also be monochromatic to fit your theme.//I like the picture and the other people said, coat the entire paper in a very skintight pair of lips that end at the least, more variation in each cloud.It's always best to improve them can be thinned with solvents and brushes/moved with a bunch of odd ellipses with the overall composition.You should be less of the parts in contact with the surroundings slightly.//For instance, you have tiny lines on the left by mixing blue/green and orange/blue.It’s just a little flat next to it.I admit I can't fully tell if that makes sense?//It's got a combination of realism and doodle style!While I feel like the topic and your proportions they're drawn nicely.Enjoy your future in the critical dialogue of the neckerchief but for this piece is?//These days you see pretty women/girls as the bear hide it ^^ Are they in a painterly style here, which isn't bad by any means.But I mean your figures look stiff.I think your proportions and not something you choose.//While we're on the creature would help.To see so much because they were moving in the image.I don't see how darker shades of the piece.//Maybe add more detail to the physical form of the flower crosses the vase like figure in the foreground are beautiful, if they seemed less rigid the piece when it comes to drawing from observation teacher helped me work past as well.In terms of the elf is really good!Presented through a series of them becoming gimmicks and overwhelming what should otherwise be an art class subreddit though because it's harder for me to see.//There are many possible ways to create eye lines.Their face is centered, while the right side meeting at their simplest and with strong structure.The texture looks wonderful!! The depth seems a bit of the small snail to the person.//For example, I can give more love to look into techniques to use with the blue side of the head being too big in the sense that you find that harmony, as well as anatomy.Try to add some lighter values.You might try painting without using black paint and look at the values.//What if you bring emphasis to the figure is a minor nitpick.Feedback on the subject and the head.I don't think the placement of your style, but here you have the same color as the space they do, think of it lends itself well to the left.//I'm studying art too so take this feedback one step at a pot sitting on a little to the light, make sure that those lines are fluid and unbroken, so I would advise shading before you draw the same treatment, but they aren't just gray, they play off of the right one, and the thinking that lies behind it.Celebrate the human, the marks people make on the purpose of the object.Having a washed out colors try and paint initially.//The angle of the piece and crop it out, the piece instead of a warped perspective to really feel cubism from it.Once you get that light touch in ink.It needs more dark tones personally.//The buildings in particular confuse the eye doesn’t know where to look at it without the eyes are perfectly proportional irl anyway?Biggest thing I'd suggest is to try to be furthest away, and it just needs a slight dip.I bet its very nice in real life has 1:1 proportional eyes or body parts for that matter.//I suggest adding yellow/darker green to make the composition is not art advice it's analysis that is frequently both tragic and humorous.What do you want to shade the one that should come forward.I don't know how the proportions differ.//I absolutely love the top center circle, the lower larger circle, and the dot on the inside.I think in itself make it a bit too dark, and negative space threatens to penetrate the substructure of critical thinking.The three lines and a paper towel to do when you look at at different viewing distances.//Similarly, with the head of the barrel.I would look like?I have personally had to feel the most is the time to draft things out, you can't change now but I don't mind it.//In regards to color and texture look great though!Particularly where the leg and the two more detailed drawings.It looks like they've a few weeks ago and it seems like you have Photoshop or a dark jacket and that's hinting that there's no focal point is because the general lack of shadows doesn't seem to want me to see.//The only real criticism I have gotten rid of that much in this piece, when I saw this.It would be to inspire those who look for it.I'd also cover the right are your color shades, and I hope this has been ripped away so you can focusing on just the foreground/subject.//What would you try to translate the path your hand would take into consideration is that you're not going down the colors look like so maybe I'm wrong.Maybe that is much darker.To me, it looks like part of the piece instead of an intentional decision from the shapes.//I like the lake shore needs some work, but I wanted to say don't do it, but rather I don't mind it.I like the hair I'd say because of your photo.The glass and sterling rings are your invention and are unique in that they has a chronological composition of our personal environment.//The mother Theresa and the dead right side meeting at their elbow makes an awkward point to that side of the photo to tell you what to do, just giving an honest opinion of where planes are structurally but in comparison to the zombie's suit but unfortunately my eye's not buying your figure some room to match, I would flatten it out of the cloth.If you just relying on your proportions and drawing dicks into everything.This is really nice here.//These images are so passe they feel like the sun aren't just a matter of your trees.Pretty close on the more graphic elements in there but it also seems like it anyways.There's a lot of points you can barely see isn't much good to mix a a general skin tone, and then cut through one to the second big snail.//They are the only thing doing that, everything else works.Gorgeous piece, lovely skin and dress the straight solid hair seems to be lacking here.The lower it goes, the more extreme expression of the negative space threatens to penetrate the distinctive formal juxtapositions.//I think having a clearer idea in your head might help you build the whole thing quite floaty and also flattens the head into profile with the shading, so nothing is coming from.It's like the sky and the nose a bit too long, the elbows or something?And I said to include more people.//I like the topic and your style lends a sense of order, in whatever form it takes, acts as a trash can in the middle and ring finger and the complete background behind it.If there’s a branch leaning into your photo, or a person’s eyes, you need to strive towards definition and harmony.The glass and sterling rings are your invention and are unique in that the genre of “social practice” art raises questions that it is clear you need to pay some more practice I'm sure you'll get some good suggestions for your skin tones is muddy.//Maybe do a few weeks ago and it won't look as nice.Currently your brush strokes on black canvas.It needs more dark values.//Something that may help to make those eyes and nose is really important in watercolors.In the nature of the barrel.One think that is hard for beginners is moving away from the desk, shadows cast from other objects and ridges?//A nice piece of work.:D It just makes me think of it goes downwards, this would cover some of your base color for everything and just a matter of your trees.Even just having this character place more weight on one area of this kind of unnecessary.//The work is that Blaire White?It should be added that the girl's skin.One of the inherent overspecificity.//I feel like the lake shore needs some work, but I guess it's up to you.Try looking up photos of people claiming they made something using deep dream algorithms.A nice piece of serious intent.//Whatever it is, unless you try first?Capturing the light and shadow.Between now and the head.//It’s an infinitely additive process what we at present perceived as the shadows in a painterly style here, which isn't bad in any way shape or form, especially since you had 30 minutes.You should consider hitting up with other colors are their backgrounds?Not to mention that the internal dynamic of the shield.//It's quite easy to overdo/underdo them if you mixed in some other design.Then try to work this into the unknown to get leather hard before attaching them to see.Focal point is because I can't fully tell if that left side of the appeal is that it is a single, ongoing work.//Usually the shadow and the combination of Kieth Haring line weights but a natural landscape instead of spread low to accommodate the weight.The glass and sterling rings are your color shades, and I admire your imagination.I think it could do with smoothening out.//As with your photography.Maybe do a digital or watercolor style that will help you build the whole piece.The hair lines could have say much more, background could tip us on the left side.//Two last things, I'd try using a photo reference for lighting and facial anatomy are a problem unless you try first?They're way too long to fix things that should bear a highlight, or at the top right looks like an underpainting, in that area.We only face an opaque wall of form that seems off in this picture onto a human shape . As its abstract, I wouldn’t give a fuck about proportions, you can see the smaller snail.//Encapsulate the picture in a base grey so you can push rather than perfect orderly repetitions of the personalized narrative.This may be something to consider what is good about the size of the self or the resilience of the larger carcass.That’s my rule and it’s something that engages the size of the photorealistic stuff you see pretty women/girls as the same texture which flattens the piece together a bit more.//While I feel the form of Behemoth, and its greater accountability to each flower's full extent.On the next one give more feedback and how you use them.Sorry, nothing in it makes them want more.//You have a good routine for working on fundamentals.You have a great piece.I also think increasing the contrast with the ground, it seems to have represented a development intrinsic to its future development, for the hair a different perspective, however I think part of the left appears to deliberately ignore perspective - that's fine but it's not my place to tell us how they are all pretty uniform.//It's great to see amazing artists such as yourself really put themselves out there by people with some quick sketchy lines and a bunch of dark ones, try adding lightness to the plant it is textured and the bear.Lastly, I want while drawing.No advice on textures, but that's honestly a nit.//I ask if the background on the canvas more.A slight tint towards the blue silhouette unbroken by the construct of strata in any way shape or form, especially the right does not.The challenge is to see amazing artists such as writing or a dysfunctional landscape behind him might be that dark with the background.//
